# Ritual

For this project, you will be making a prototype mobile app interface in support of a positive ritual.

A ritual is a designed experience that combines habits and routine with symbolism and meaning. Rituals are not intended to be logical and rational events, but are instead opportunities for reflection, celebration, connectivity, focus, reinforcement, and more.
