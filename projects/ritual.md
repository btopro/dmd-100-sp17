# Ritual

For this project, you will be designing a ritual and producing a prototype mobile app interface that supports the ritual in some way.

A ritual is a designed experience that combines habits and routine with symbolism, ultimately producing an event or moment that has meaning. Rituals are not necessarily intended to be utilitarian events, but are instead opportunities for reflection, celebration, connectivity, behavioral nudging, focus, reinforcement, and more. An example of a small ritual could be a group of retirees who have lunch together every week or a busy professional who writes reflective journal entries at the end of the day. Large rituals inlcude graduation ceremonies, weddings, and organized sporting events like football and baseball.

A ritual is an interesting design problem because it deals with a person's value system, and focuses their time and actions on
