# Brainstorm

Now that you have a direction, it's time to brainstorm some ideas. Generating ideas by yourself \(AKA â€“ in a vacuum\) can be fairly difficult if you are new to this process. Even experienced designers benefit from working in groups because typically the array of ideas generated in a discussion is far larger than when working alone. For this step, you will partner up with small groups to brainstorm ideas for each person's project.

Groups can meet by setting up a time to have a video call.

## Materials

* Pen, pencil
* Journal
* poster-board, wall space

## **Roles and Rules**

### Discussion Rounds

1. Introduce yourselves if you don't already all know each other.
2. There will be one brainstorming round for each person in the group.
3. Each round will focus on a different person's HMW question.
4. For each round, the person currently in focus for the discussion will be the designated recorder of the discussion, and is responsible for uploading the recorded accounts of the conversation.
5. Spend about 10-15 minutes minutes per round

### Brainstorming Rules

1. Quantity over quality. The goal is to generate as many ideas as possible.

2. Defer judgement. Silly and outlandish ideas are just as useful as sensible ideas.

3. 


1. Using your poster-board or wall space, start writing down the ideas.
