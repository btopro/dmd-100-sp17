# Deliver: Hypertext Story
In this phase, you will use a tool called Twine to create an interactive narrative. This is a bit like a choose your own adventure book, where you can follow different paths should you choose to make more than one.

Twine is available as a downloadable app for Linux, OSX, and Windows, or as an online editor located at [twinery.org/2](https://twinery.org/2/). You can use either to complete this project.
