# Deliver: Hypertext Story

## Building with Twine

1. Use Twinery.org to create a hypertext narrative from the narrative that you wrote in the development phase of the project.
2. Follow the project tutorial to create either a linear or non-linear narrative. Your narrative should take no longer than 5 minutes to get through the critical pathway. 

## Submission
1. Post the web link of your Twine narrative to the Studio Project feed for the class to review.
2. Download the Twine file and submit to the Studio Project Dropbox. Post the URL to the Studio page for your classmates to review.
