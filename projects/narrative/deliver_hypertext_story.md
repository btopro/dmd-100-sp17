# Deliver: Hypertext Story

## Building with Twine

1. Follow the Twine Tutorial to learn how to create either a linear or non-linear narrative. Your narrative should take no longer than 10 minutes for a viewer get through the critical pathway.
2. You can add as many supporting events or nodes as you want. If you are unsure of what type of story to produce, start with a linear narrative model. Refer back to the story structure topic for more information.
2. Use Twinery.org to create a hypertext narrative from the narrative that you wrote in the development phase of the project.

## Submission
1. Post the web link of your Twine narrative to the Studio Project feed for the class to review.
2. Download the Twine file and submit to the Studio Project Dropbox. Post the URL to the Studio page for your classmates to review.
