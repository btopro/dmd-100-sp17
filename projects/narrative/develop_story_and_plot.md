# Develop: Story and Plot

## Instructions

1. You will now write a fictional, yet _**plausible**_ narrative that describes how this imagined future 30 years from now came to be.
   1. For example, shape-shifting lizard people are not plausible to exist in 30 years, but technology that helps someone to change their appearance is plausible.
2. Use the following story structure checklist to build your draft:
   1. The way it was
   2. And then one day...
   3. Raising the stakes
   4. Moment of change
   5. World as it is now
3. Story elements
   1. Characters
   2. Critical pathway nodes \(events\)
   3. Branching nodes \(these are optional\)

## Report in
