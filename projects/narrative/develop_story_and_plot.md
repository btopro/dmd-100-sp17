# Develop: Story and Plot

You will now write a fictional, yet _**plausible**_ story that describes how this imagined future 30 years from now came to be. For example, Unicorns are not plausible to exist in 30 years \(unless you make a compelling CRISPR argument\), but autonomous flying cars are plausible.

## Requirements

* **Length:** The draft's length will be determined by how many plot points there are. At a minimum, you should include five plot points to map to the story structure checklist.
* **Characters:** You must have at least **two** characters. Characters do not have to be people.
* **Content:** The plot must be of a positive future.
* The story must be in the realm of technological scientific plausibility.
