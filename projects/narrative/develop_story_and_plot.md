# Develop: Story and Plot

In this activity, you will be writing a draft for your story. 

## Requirements

- **Length:** The draft's length will be determined by how many plot points there are. At a minimum, you should include five plot points to map to the story structure checklist.
- **Characters:** You must have at least **two** characters. Characters do not have to be people.
- **Content:** The plot must be of a positive future.

## Story structure

- The way it was
- And then one day...
- Raising the stakes
- Moment of change
- World as it is now


## Instructions

1. You will now write a fictional, yet _**plausible**_ narrative that describes how this imagined future 30 years from now came to be.
   1. For example, shape-shifting lizard people are not plausible to exist in 30 years, but technology that helps someone to change their appearance is plausible.
