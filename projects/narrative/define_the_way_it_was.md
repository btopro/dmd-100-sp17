# Define: The way it was

1. Choose one of the category responses. Write the response as a short sentence that explains the way it *was* in 2017, and the way it *is* in 2047. **"In the year 2017 (the way it was), but now in 2047 (how it's better world)."** . An example sentence would be: *"In 2017, the Earth's wildlife was experiencing a high rate of extinction, but now in 2047 almost all of the world's endangered wildlife species are back to healthy populations."*
2. Define your **audience**. Who would need to see this story in order for it to become a reality?
