# Develop: Iterate

Using your notes from the user test, make adjustments, clarifications, and revisions to improve your kit and instructions. Whether your users have given you general feedback or specific feedback, it is your job to interpret what they are really telling you. 

## Repeat
In an ideal situation, there would be plenty of time for several iterations. If time allows, try testing another one or two participants to see if you can further improve the instructions. 

## Report in
Upload the new iteration to the studio
