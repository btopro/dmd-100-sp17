# Develop: Iterate
Using your notes from the test, make adjustments, clarifications, and revisions to improve your instructions.

## Repeat
In an ideal situation, there would be plenty of time for several iterations. If time allows, try testing another one or two participants to see if you can further improve the instructions. 

## Report in
Upload the new iteration to the studio
