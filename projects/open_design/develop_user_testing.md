# Develop: User testing

1. Print or send your instructions from the prototyping phase.
2. Have a friend, family member, or colleague try to build it. If they are remotely located, ask them to set up their webcam or phone camera so that you can see them and their work space while they follow your instructions.
3. Write notes as they go through the process. Ask your participant to talk through their thought process.
4. Keep track of how long it takes your participant to follow your instructions.
