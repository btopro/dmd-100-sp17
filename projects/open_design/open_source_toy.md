# Open Toy Kit Project: Introduction

In this project, you will design a kit of parts that can be used to build a toy, model, or other object. This object will be a collection or kit of parts that can be reconfigured to create variations. There are two ways to approach this project. You can decide to create your own parts, custom from raw materials like cardboard, wood, foam, etc. Or, you could develop creative ways of using commonly found objects like stationary \(rubber bands, paper clips, etc\). The goal of this project is to develop a kit using commonly available resources. According to the most [recent and comprehensive data](http://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/poverty-and-shared-prosperity), 10.7% of the world's population lives in poverty, so the easier it is for others to create or obtain your parts, the better.

**Requirements:**

1. Parts should be modular \( avoid parts that are difficult to construct or provide instructions for constructing.\)
2. A kit should have more than one part \(parts may be the same shape, but must be

There are many example of modular toys and kits on the Internet. If you decide to take direct inspiration and remix other works and ideas, you must ensure that there is a good balance between copying, transforming, and combining. It must be obvious that this project came from you.

notes:  
1. Template for users to build their own modular toys?  
2. What kind of toys will be made?  
3. What raw building materials are used, and for what parts?  
4. What tools and fasteners will be needed?  
5. Will there be standard or modular parts?  
4. What making processes will the users undergo?  
3. What are the instructions?   
4. Test run  
5. Prototype
