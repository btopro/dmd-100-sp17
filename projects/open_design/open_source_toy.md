# Open Toy Kit Project

## Brief

In this project, you will design a kit of parts that can be used to build a toy, model, or other object. This object will be a collection or kit of parts that can be reconfigured to create variations. This is serious \(though playful\) product design. There are two ways to approach this project. You can decide to create your own parts, create custom parts from raw materials like cardboard, wood, foam, and others. Or, you could develop creative ways of using commonly found objects like rubber bands, toothpicks, paper clips, etc. The goal of this project is to develop a kit using commonly available resources. According to the most [recent and comprehensive data](http://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/poverty-and-shared-prosperity), 10.7% of the world's population lives in poverty, so the easier and cheaper it is for others to create or obtain your parts, the more accessible your project will be.




## Category

What kind of kit are you building?

**Category ideas:**

* Human or animal figures
* Architectural models
* Machines
* Structures and shapes
* Puzzle or game
* Integrated electronics

## Part types

* Symbols
* Shapes
* Fasteners
* Connectors
* Support structures

### Attributes

* Name
* Description
* Is this modular or a unique \(one-off\) component?
* Quantity
* Cost breakdown

## Variations

How many variations that can be constructed by reconfiguring the same parts?

## Kit prototype

How will you help users gain mastery of using the kit?

1. **Create instructions for your users to follow.** Instructions can include any one of or combination of photos or drawings, diagrams, audio, pre-recorded video, and/or step-based text instructions. Select your media based on the user's age.
2. Instructions should include any process or technique required to prepare parts and how to combine parts together. 



## Requirements:

1. Parts should be simple \( avoid parts that are difficult to construct or provide instructions for constructing.\)

2. A kit should have more than one part \(parts may be the same\)

There are many examples of modular toys and kits in stores and on the Internet. If you decide to take direct inspiration and remix other works and ideas, you must ensure that there is a good balance between copying, transforming, and combining. There must be some novelty in your work, and it should be obvious that this project came from you.

**Develop phase questions:**

1. Template for users to build their own modular toys?
2. What kind of toys will be made?
3. What raw building materials are used, and for what parts?
4. What tools and fasteners will be needed?
5. Will there be standard or modular parts?
6. What making processes will the users undergo?
7. What are the instructions?

**Deliver phase notes:**

1. Prototype
2. Test run/feedback/refine

**Documentation:**

The kit should be documented in a photography style known as _**knolling**_: [Examples](http://theultralinx.com/2013/09/50-amazing-examples-knolling-photography/)
