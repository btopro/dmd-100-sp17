# Open Source Toy

In this project, you will design a toy. This toy will be a collection or kit of parts that can be reconfigured to create variations. There are two ways to approach this project. You can decide to create your own parts, custom from raw materials like cardboard, wood, foam, etc. Or, you could develop creative ways of using commonly found objects like rubber bands, paper clips, etc. According to the most [recent and comprehensive data](http://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/poverty-and-shared-prosperity), 10.7% of the world's population lives in poverty, so the easier it is for others to create or obtain your parts, the better. 

There are many example of modular toys and kits on the Internet. Remember, if you decide to take direct inspiration, you must ensure that there is a good balance between copying, editing, and transforming. It must be obvious that this project came from you.

You don't necessarily have to invent a new modular system, though you should adapt
