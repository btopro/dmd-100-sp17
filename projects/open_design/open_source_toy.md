# Open Toy Kit Project: Introduction

In this project, you will design a kit of parts that can be used to build a toy, model, or other object. This object will be a collection or kit of parts that can be reconfigured to create variations. There are two ways to approach this project. You can decide to create your own parts, custom from raw materials like cardboard, wood, foam, etc. Or, you could develop creative ways of using commonly found objects like rubber bands, toothpicks, paper clips, etc. The goal of this project is to develop a kit using commonly available resources. According to the most [recent and comprehensive data](http://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/poverty-and-shared-prosperity), 10.7% of the world's population lives in poverty, so the easier and cheaper it is for others to create or obtain your parts, the more accessible your project will be.

## Requirements:

1. Parts should be modular \( avoid parts that are difficult to construct or provide instructions for constructing.\)
2. A kit should have more than one part \(parts may be the same\)

There are many example of modular toys and kits on the Internet. If you decide to take direct inspiration and remix other works and ideas, you must ensure that there is a good balance between copying, transforming, and combining. There must be some novelty in your work, and it should be obvious that this project came from you.

**Develop phase questions:**

1. Template for users to build their own modular toys?
2. What kind of toys will be made?
3. What raw building materials are used, and for what parts?
4. What tools and fasteners will be needed?
5. Will there be standard or modular parts?
6. What making processes will the users undergo?
7. What are the instructions?

**Deliver phase notes:**

1. Prototype
2. Test run/feedback/refine

**Documentation:**

The kit should be documented in a photography style known as _**knolling**_: [Examples](http://theultralinx.com/2013/09/50-amazing-examples-knolling-photography/)
