# Develop: Design Principles

What is it that makes your toy modular? Is the the shape of the pieces? Is it the way pieces are attached? One of the constraints of the project is that you should be able to use the same modular parts to make toy variations. How they will vary will depend on what attributes define the design.

To see an example, let's look at how the [Open Structures project](http://beta.openstructures.net/pages/9) has defined their design guidelines. (1) Design for disassembly, (2) Design with recyclable materials, (3) Design from the OS grid.
