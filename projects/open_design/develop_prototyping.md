# Develop: Prototyping

## Instructions

1. Revisit your primary and secondary research. Make note of any insights, themes, or opportunities that you want to explore.
2. Experiment. Transform manipulate materials, use objects, and create aesthetic modifications.
3. Make note and document any interesting outcomes.
4. Make variations of your objects.
5. Create a materials list, tools list, and instructions so that another person can create reproduce the toy.

## Kit

### Photo Documentation should include:

1. Single kit of parts image: knolling style
2. Photos of various assemblies demonstrating the modular or reconfigurable characteristics of the kit

## Requirements:

1. Parts should be simple \( avoid parts that are difficult to construct or provide instructions for constructing.\)

2. A kit should have more than one part \(parts may be the same\)

There are many examples of modular toys and kits in stores and on the Internet. If you decide to take direct inspiration and remix other works and ideas, you must ensure that there is a good balance between copying, transforming, and combining. There must be some novelty in your work, and it should be obvious that this project came from you.

**Develop phase questions:**

1. Template for users to build their own modular toys?
2. What kind of toys will be made?
3. What raw building materials are used, and for what parts?
4. What tools and fasteners will be needed?
5. Will there be standard or modular parts?
6. What making processes will the users undergo?
7. What are the instructions?
