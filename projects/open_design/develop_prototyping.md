# Develop: Prototyping

Experiment with materials, objects, and aesthetic marks.
What kind of toys are you going to make in keeping with your target age?
Write instructions and make a prototype of the parts.
Testing: Have a friend, family member, or colleague try to build it. Take notes, and keep time.
