3. **Start experimenting.** Transform manipulate materials, use objects, and create visual modifications.
    1. Take photos of your experiments and outcomes as you work. Don't worry if they are rough or ambiguous.
    2. Five (5) photos minimum.
5. Once you you are happy with what you came up with, start to make variations.
