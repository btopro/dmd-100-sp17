# Narrative Project: Civic Imagination

## Brief:

For this project, you will create a hypertext story focused on building a better future world, set in the year 2047. A hypertext story is one that is told through a series of hyperlinks, each hyperlink leading to another node in the story. You will follow a design process that will help you generate ideas, create drafts, obtain feedback, and iterate towards a solution.

## Tools
- Pencil/pen
- Journal
- Internet Access

## Process

### Discover

#### Question development
1. In your journal, write three objects from your home. If you cannot think of any, choose three objects from a random object generator. Here is [one](http://roger.redevised.com/). (2 mins)
2. Free association writing. (10 mins)
  - On a journal page, write as many adjectives to this object as you can as one word responses.
3. Choose three adjectives.
2. Choose a focus word. Write the reaction from step 3 in front of one of the categories chosen from the following list.:
  - education
  - economy
  - health
  - wellness
  - transportation
  - technology
  - government
  - freedom
  - justice
  - democracy
  - business
  - trade
  - environment
  - food
  - agriculture
  - energy
  - labor
3. Now that you have selected one categories, write the words pairs onto paper, or into a shared document (Google docs, Box notes, etc). Everyone in the session should see the paper/document.
4. Imagine an ideal or positive situation for that category for the year 2047. Think of a one-sentence description to explain that scenario. Try to have an inspiration source for your ideas, though you do not need to mention it. Inspiration can come from film, books, news, personal experiences, etc. For example, a news article for [drone pizza delivery](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/innovations/wp/2016/08/25/hungry-your-pizza-drone-will-be-there-in-30-minutes/) might inspire an idea for aerial, internet-connected drones to bring virtual doctor consultations to remote villages. Write at least one response per category, but feel free to write down as many as you like. Limit yourself to 20 minutes. **Take a photo of this process and post it to the Studio Project feed**

### Define

1. Choose one of the category responses. Write the response as a short sentence that explains the way it *was* in 2017, and the way it *is* in 2047. **"In the year 2017 [the way it was], but now in 2047 [how it's better world]."** . An example sentence would be *In 2017, the Earth's wildlife was experiencing a high rate of extinction, but now in 2047 almost all of the world's endangered wildlife species are back to healthy populations.*
2. Define your **audience**. Who would need to see this story in order for it to become a reality?

### Develop

1. You will now use Twine to create a fictional, yet ***plausible*** narrative that describes how this imagined future you have described came to be. For example, shape-shifting lizard people are not plausible, but technology developed to enable a person to change their appearance at will is plausible. Develop and include the following in your story.
  -  Characters
  -  Conflict
  -  Resolution

Produce Draft 1, get feedback
Draft 2, get feedback

### Deliver

1. Post the web link of your Twine narrative to the Studio Project feed for the class to review.
2. Download the Twine file and submit to the Studio Project Dropbox. Post the URL to the Studio page for your classmates to review.

### Discuss

1. Now that you've produced a hypertext story, it's time to leave feedback for your classmates. Review three of your classmates' work and write a response that includes the following: 
  - What did you notice?
  - Where elements of dramatic plot evident?
  - Was the story about a positive future? How do you know?
  - What themes emerged in the story?
  - Who do you think the audience is?
2. Document Opportunities
  - After receiving feedback on your project, write any opportunities that were discovered via conversation.
