# Narrative Project: Civic Imagination

## Brief:

For this project, you will create a hypertext story focused on building a better future world, set in the year 2047. A hypertext story is one that is told through a series of hyperlinks, each hyperlink leading to another node in the story. You will follow a design process that will help you generate ideas, create drafts, obtain feedback, and iterate towards a solution.

## Tools
- Pencil/pen
- Journal
- Internet Access
- Twine

## Process

### Discover

#### Question development
1. In your journal, write three objects from your home. If you cannot think of any, choose three objects from a random object generator. Here is [one](http://roger.redevised.com/). (2 mins)
2. Free association writing. (10 mins)
  - On a journal page, write as many adjectives about this object as you can.
  - Circle three adjectives.
3. Choose a focus word from the list below. Write the adjectives circled from the previous step in front of your chosen focus word, creating three word-pairs:
  - education
  - economy
  - health
  - wellness
  - transportation
  - technology
  - government
  - freedom
  - justice
  - democracy
  - business
  - trade
  - environment
  - food
  - agriculture
  - ecosystem
  - energy
  - labor
4. Now that you have created three word-pairs, write each one onto a separate journal page.
  - Imagine it is the year 2047 and an ideal or positive situation has occurred, inspired by the word-pair. Think of one-sentence descriptions to explain the scenario. Try to have an inspiration source for your ideas, though you do not need to mention it. Inspiration can come from film, books, news, personal experiences, etc. For example, a news article for [drone pizza delivery](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/innovations/wp/2016/08/25/hungry-your-pizza-drone-will-be-there-in-30-minutes/) might inspire an idea for a fleet of autonomous drones continually powered by the sun that search and report animal poachers to the authorities. Write as many responses per word-pairs as you can. Limit yourself to 30 minutes. **Take photos or scan your journal pages and post them to the Studio Project feed**

### Define

1. Choose one of the category responses. Write the response as a short sentence that explains the way it *was* in 2017, and the way it *is* in 2047. **"In the year 2017 [the way it was], but now in 2047 [how it's better world]."** . An example sentence would be *In 2017, the Earth's wildlife was experiencing a high rate of extinction, but now in 2047 almost all of the world's endangered wildlife species are back to healthy populations.*
2. Define your **audience**. Who would need to see this story in order for it to become a reality?

### Develop

1. You will now use Twine to create a fictional, yet ***plausible*** narrative that describes how this imagined future you have described came to be. For example, shape-shifting lizard people are not plausible, but technology developed to enable a person to change their appearance at will is plausible. Develop and include the following in your story.
2. Story structure checklist
  1. The way it was
  2. And then one day...
  3. Raising the stakes
  4. Moment of change
  5. World as it is now 
3. Story elements
  -  Characters
  -  Plot: critical pathway nodes
  -  Plot: optional nodes
Produce Draft 1, get feedback
Draft 2, get feedback

### Deliver

1. Post the web link of your Twine narrative to the Studio Project feed for the class to review.
2. Download the Twine file and submit to the Studio Project Dropbox. Post the URL to the Studio page for your classmates to review.

### Discuss

1. Now that you've produced a hypertext story, it's time to leave feedback for your classmates. Review three of your classmates' work and write a response that includes the following: 
  - What did you notice?
  - Where elements of dramatic plot evident?
  - Was the story about a positive future? How do you know?
  - What themes emerged in the story?
  - Who do you think the audience is?
2. Document Opportunities
  - After receiving feedback on your project, write any opportunities that were discovered via conversation.
