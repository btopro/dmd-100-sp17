# Narrative Project: Civic Imagination

## Brief:

For this project, you will create a hypertext story focused on building a better future world, set in the year 2047. A hypertext story is one that is told through a series of hyperlinks, each hyperlink leading to another node in the story. You will follow a design process that will help you generate ideas, create drafts, obtain feedback, and iterate towards a solution.

## Tools
- Pencil
- Paper
- Internet Access

## Process

### Discover

#### Brainstorming
1. Form group of 3-4 people and hold a real-time discussion or video chat.
  - Roles: Assign someone to be a record the ideas.
2. As a group, choose three categories that seem the most interesting from the following list (or add your own category):
  - education
  - economy
  - health/wellness
  - transportation
  - technology
  - government
  - freedom
  - justice
  - democracy
  - business/trade
  - environment
  - food/agriculture
  - energy
  - labor
  - other...
3. Now that you have selected three categories, write the categories onto paper, or into a shared document (Google docs, Box notes, etc). Everyone in the session should see the paper/document.
4. Imagine an ideal or positive situation for that category for the year 2045. Think of a one-sentence description to explain that scenario. Try to have an inspiration source for your ideas, though you do not need to mention it. Inspiration can come from film, books, news, personal experiences, etc. For example, a news article for drone pizza delivery might inspire an idea for aerial, internet-connected drones to bring virtual doctor consultations to remote villages. Write at least one response per category, but feel free to write down as many as you like. Limit yourself to 20 minutes. **Take a photo of this process and post it to the Studio Project feed**

**Sentence structure:** The way it was, and the way it is now.

**Example sentences:** Government officials used to have a conflict of interest with their constituents, but then the 

### Define

1. Choose one of the category responses. Write the response as a short sentence, **"In 2045 years, ... "** . An example sentence would be *In 2045, the world will restore all of the world's endangered wildlife species to healthy populations.*
2. Define your **audience**. Who would need to see this story in order for it to become a reality?

### Develop

1. You will now use Twine to create a fictional, yet ***plausible*** narrative that describes how this imagined future you have described came to be. For example, shape-shifting lizard people are not plausible, but technology developed to enable a person to change their appearance at will is plausible. Develop and include the following in your story.
  -  Characters
  -  Conflict
  -  Resolution

Produce Draft 1, get feedback
Draft 2, get feedback

### Deliver

1. Post the web link of your Twine narrative to the Studio Project feed for the class to review.
2. Download the Twine file and submit to the Studio Project Dropbox. Post the URL to the Studio page for your classmates to review.

### Discuss

1. Now that you've produced a hypertext story, it's time to leave feedback for your classmates. Review three of your classmates' work and write a response that includes the following: 
  - What did you notice?
  - Where elements of dramatic plot evident?
  - Was the story about a positive future? How do you know?
  - What themes emerged in the story?
  - Who do you think the audience is?
2. Document Opportunities
  - After receiving feedback on your project, write any opportunities that were discovered via conversation.
