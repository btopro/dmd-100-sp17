# Narrative Project: Civic Imagination

## Brief:

In this project, you will go through a design thinking process that inspires a hypertext narrative. In your story, you will imagine a better future world for the year 2045.

## Tools
- Pencil
- Paper
- Internet Access

## Process

### Discover
  1. Choose three categories that seem the most interesting from the following list:
    - education
    - economy
    - health/wellness
    - transportation
    - technology
    - government
    - freedom
    - justice
    - democracy
    - business/trade
    - environment
    - food/agriculture
    - energy
    - labor
  2. Now that you have selected three categories, write them across the top of a sheet of paper to form three columns. Imagine an ideal or positive situation for that category for the year 2045. Respond to each category with a short one-sentence description of this scenario. Try to have an inspiration source for your ideas, though you do not need to mention it (IE - Flying cars as shown in the film, Blade Runner might inspire my idea that in the future, ). Write at least one response per category, but feel free to write down as many as you like. Limit yourself to 10 minutes. **Take a photo of your process and post it to the Studio Project feed**

### Define

1. Choose one of the category responses. Write the response as a short sentence, **"In 2045 years, ... "** . An example sentence would be *In 2045, the world will restore all of the world's endangered wildlife species to healthy populations.*
2. Define your **audience**. Who would need to see this story in order for it to become a reality?

### Develop

1. You will now use Twine to create a fictional, yet ***plausible*** narrative that describes how this imagined future you have described came to be. For example, shape-shifting lizard people are not plausible, but technology developed to enable a person to change their appearance at will is plausible. Develop and include the following in your story.
  -  Characters
  -  Conflict
  -  Resolution

### Deliver

1. Post the web link of your Twine narrative to the Studio Project feed for the class to review.
2. Download the Twine file and submit to the Studio Project Dropbox. Post the URL to the Studio page for your classmates to review.

### Discuss

1. Now that you've produced a hypertext story, it's time to leave feedback for your classmates. Review three of your classmates' work and write a response that includes the following: 
  - What did you notice?
  - Where elements of dramatic plot evident?
  - Was the story about a positive future? How do you know?
  - What themes emerged in the story?
  - Who do you think the audience is?
2. Document Opportunities
  - After receiving feedback on your project, write any opportunities that were discovered via conversation.
