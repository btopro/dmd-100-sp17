## Instructions

1. Write your name in the middle of an 8.5"x11" sheet of paper placed horizontally.
2. In a circle around your name, write _**skills**_, _**weaknesses**_, _**familiar**_, and _**unfamiliar**_. Draw lines from the center circle to each category.
3. From each category, draw a line to a specific idea that is true. Write and connect the _skills_ you have, your _weaknesses_, the things you are most _familiar_ with, and the things of which you are _unfamiliar_. For example, if you are good at making a certain type of food, you could connect that to _skills_. The more specific you can be, the better. Your answers can be funny, but consider your audience and try not to over-share.
4. Spend 15 minutes writing as many specific ideas as you can. This process will give you good overview of some of your local knowledge.
