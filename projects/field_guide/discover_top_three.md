# Discover: Mind mapping

Local knowledge describes a kind of knowledge that is specific to your own experiences. Is this step, you will create a mind map to try to better understand your local knowledge.

## Instructions

1. Write your name In the middle of an 8.5"x11" sheet of paper placed horizontally.
2. In a circle around your name, write _**skills**_, _**weaknesses**_, _**places**_, _**topics**_, and _**values**_. Draw lines from the center circle to each category.
3. From each category, draw a line to a specific idea that is true. Write and connect the _skills_ you have, the _places_ you know well, the _topics_ you are most knowledgable about, and your _values_. For example, if you are good at making your own pasta sauce, you could connect that to _skills_. If you know the best restaurants in Portland, you could connect that to _places_. If you are really bad at folding shirts, connect that to _weaknesses_. If you know a lot about bees, you could connect that to _topics_, and if you really care about good sportsmanship in football, you could connect that to _values_. The more specific you can be, the better. Your answers can be funny, but consider your audience and try not to over-share.
4. Spend 15 minutes writing as many specific ideas as you can. This process will give you good overview of some of your local knowledge.
