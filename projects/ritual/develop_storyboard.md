# Develop: Storyboard

Using the ideas generated during the brainstorm, you will now map out key aspects of the ritual in storyboard form. You can think of a storyboard as a sequence of drawings or images that communicate how the ritual will occur. This will give others the opportunity to provide feedback, and forces the designer to think about all of the key decisions in more detail.

## Materials

* Pen or pencil
* Journal
* Camera or scanner

## Parts of a ritual

There are many descriptions available of what a ritual is, and how it functions. We will consider four key aspects as core design components for the ritual.

1. **Script:** The script describes the triggers and the associated events.
2. **Frame:** The frame is the mental model that suggests what the ritual's purpose is, and what the intended outcome is.
3. **Trigger:** A trigger could be a time of day, the onset of a certain feeling, or some other moment that initiates the ritual, and the rituals various actions.
4. **Event:** An event is any action or performance that occurs in the ritual. Indication to start an event comes from a trigger or script.

## Steps to completion

1. In your journal, identify the **triggers**, and **events**.
