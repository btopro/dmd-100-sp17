# Develop: Test and Iterate

Now that your prototype is done, it is time to participate in feedback. You will be assigned two prototypes to review. Please provide feedback based on the following criteria:

1. Read the description of the app prototype
2. Are you able to clearly understandig of the relationship between the app and the ritual? Why or why not?
3. Does the app seem like it would facilitate the ritual? If not, why? 
4. Submit your answers to your assigned Studio 

Your prototype will also be reviewed by your classmates. This is an opportunity to learn how to recieve feedback. Enduring critique of your work might seem like a stressful process at first, but it is one of the most common, and useful processes in design. At Apple, Inc., Steve Jobs was a notorius critic on employees work, and at times vicious. What many employees learned to do was to interpret what Steve was saying, so they could elicit useful information.
