# Ritual Project: Interview
Field research is a central part of the human-centered design process. You will now practice field research by finding and interviewing a person who will become your user.

## Materials
1. Journal
2. Something to write with

## Conduct an interview
Set up an interview. It can be a family member, a friend, a colleague at work, etc. The purpose of this interview is to understand the challenges that a person faces.

Asking why helps us to better understand an ambiguous issue and gets to a more emotional aspect of a problem.

### 1. Find issues

Start by asking your participant about something they do every day that they find distracting, challenging, frustrating, or something they wish they didn't have to do. Record their responses in your journal.

### 2. Five 'Why?'s

If your participant has many responses, focus on one response. Ask your participant **why**, five times. Five is important because core issues will start to emerge around four or five levels deep. Ask about their responses specifically to avoid horizontal questions. For example, "Why else didn't you get your homework done?" is a horizontal question. "Why didn't you have enough time to complete the assignment?" is a deeper question. Record their responses in your journal.

### 3. 
Now that you have completed asking why, make a note of any of your responses pointed to a deeper core issue? Was this surprising?

## Deliverables
1. Write your recording in the observations input box on the assignment submission.
