# Ritual Project

## Interview Instructions
Complete Part A and B, which have been divided into steps.

## Asking 'Five Whys'
The goal of Part A is to better understand a potentially complex or ambiguous issue and get to a more human or emotional aspect of a problem.

### Step 1

1. What are three things you struggle with? Write them down in your journal.
2. Which one impacts you the most? Circle it.

### Step 2

Look at the response you circled in **Step 1**. Why is this a struggle? Write a short response in your journal.

### Step 3

Read your response to **Step 2**. Why do you think that is? Record the response in your journal.

### Step 4

Bear with this process, it is repetitive, but for good reason. Now read your response to **Step 3**. Why do you think that is? Record the response in your journal.

### Step 5

Almost done. Now read your response to **Step 4**. Why do you think that is? Record the response in your journal.

### Step 6

Finally, read your response to **Step 5**. Why do you think that is? Record the response in your journal.

### Step 7
Now that you have completed "Five Whys", do you think any of your responses pointed to a deeper core issue? Was this surprising?

## Deliverables
1. Write your recording in the observations input box on the assignment submission.
