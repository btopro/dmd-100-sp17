# Interview
The purpose of this interview is to understand the challenges that a user faces.

## Asking 'Five Whys'
Asking why helps us to better understand a potentially complex or ambiguous issue and get to a more human or emotional aspect of a problem.

### Step 1

Start by asking your participant about something they do every day that they find distracting, challenging, frustrating, or something they wish they didn't have to do. Record their responses in your journal.

### Step 2

Ask them **why**, five times. Five is important because core issues will start to emerge around four or five levels deep. Ask about their responses specifically to avoid horizontal questions. For example, "Why else didn't you get your homework done?" is a horizontal question. "Why didn't you have enough time to complete the assignment?" is a deeper question.

### Step 3

Read your response to **Step 2**. Why do you think that is? Record the response in your journal.

### Step 4

Bear with this process, it is repetitive, but for good reason. Now read your response to **Step 3**. Why do you think that is? Record the response in your journal.

### Step 5

Almost done. Now read your response to **Step 4**. Why do you think that is? Record the response in your journal.

### Step 6

Finally, read your response to **Step 5**. Why do you think that is? Record the response in your journal.

### Step 7
Now that you have completed "Five Whys", do you think any of your responses pointed to a deeper core issue? Was this surprising?

## Deliverables
