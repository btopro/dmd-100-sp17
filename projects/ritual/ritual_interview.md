# Ritual Project - Five Whys
Complete Part A and B, which have been divided into steps.

## Part A: Respond
The goal of Part A is to better understand a potentially complex or ambiguous issue and get to a more human or emotional aspect of a problem.

### Step 1

1. What are three things you struggle with? Write them down in your journal.
2. Which one impacts you the most? Circle it.

### Step 2

Look at the response you circled in **Step 1**. Why is this a struggle? Write a short response in your journal.

### Step 3

Read your response to **Step 2**. Why do you think that is?

### Step 4

Bear with this process, it is repetitive, but for good reason. Now read your response to **Step 3**. Why do you think that is?

### Step 5

Almost done. Now read your response to **Step 4**. Why do you think that is?

### Step 6

Finally, read your response to **Step 5**. Why do you think that is?

## Part B: Reflect
Now that you have completed Part A, let's complete Part B. 

### Step 1
Was there any time in Part A where you felt like you were able to get to a deeper core issue? What did you find?
 
### Step 2

## Deliverables
1. Write your recording in the observations input box on the assignment submission.
