# Develop: Prototype

Now that you have a storyboard, you will prototype a mobile application interface using a process known as paper prototyping. Paper prototyping is a quick way to simulate a product before too many resources are used to design and engineer the final product. It works as a kind of model that others can react to, giving designers and insight as to whether they are going in the right direction. The purpose of this prototype is to quickly communicate to your peers how you intend to use a mobile device application to faciliate a ritual.

## Prototyping Instructions

1. Identify parts of the storyboard that can translate into mobile application functions. For instance, if you ritual has a time component, then you can build in an timed audio cue into the prototype \(represented visually\).
2. Choose a screen size. This can be done by measuring a phone you already have, or
3. 1. Draw interface elements including buttons, images, icons, and text.
   2. Cut out the interface elements so they can be rearranged for each screen
   3. Take pictures of each app screen
   4. Upload them to InvisionApp
   5. Build interactivity using InvisionApp's built-in hotspot and linking tools
   6. 

## Design Document

Start your document with the following: "This is a prototype for an app that..." To complete the sentence, use your brainstorming ideas and storyboard. Describe the ritual in detail and how the prototype works?

## Steps to completion

1. Create the prototype using the prototyping instructions
2. Download a ZIP archive of your prototype from InvisionApp
3. Submit a Public Share Link to your submission in the Studio
4. Write a design document according to the document requirements and upload to the Studio
