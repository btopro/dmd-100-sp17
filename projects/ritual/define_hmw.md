# Define: How Might We ...?
A "How might we" (HMW) question is both an insight about what the core issue is as well as a focus aid for the design process. This question will serve as inspiration during the development and delivery phases of the project. If your development strays to far from the HMW question, the solution you deliver might be solving a different set of issues from the ones you set out to solve. Refer back to the HMW question often throughout the process.

## How might I ...?
In this project, you are the intended user, and you are designing for yourself. We will adjust the language so the question makes more sense. Please complete and write the Mad Libs style sentence in your journal. This project will be centered around developing a mobile device interface, so that constraint has been added to the sentence. Please fill in between the brackets.

How might we ***[[ description of person and the specific situation that makes overcoming obstacles harder ]]***, use a mobile device app that ***[[ rephrase your core struggle into an opportunity ]]***?


## Example Question  
In this example, let's say that I discovered that a college student friend of mine was anxious about socializing. Often times, meeting friends meant going out and spending a lot of money, but they were on a very tight budget. The HMW question might look like this:

How might we help a cash-strapped college student who is anxious about going over their monthly budget to socialize with friends?
