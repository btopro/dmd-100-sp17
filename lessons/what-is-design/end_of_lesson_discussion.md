# End of lesson discussion

Now is a good time to decompress with a class-wide open discussion. This is not graded. 

**Questions to guide the discussion:**

- Were any of your preconceptions about what design is challenged? If so, what were they?
- Do you feel a sense of anticipation or excitement to start designing, or does it seem out of reach?
