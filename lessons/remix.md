# Introduction

In this lesson, you will be learning about a design movement called **open design**.

You will continue to practice the Double Diamond design process by creating your third course project, where you will generate a physical prototype based on some common open design principles. You will also continue reading and responding to writing prompts for  _Design and Truth_ book chapters, and have the opportunity to listen to more podcasts.
