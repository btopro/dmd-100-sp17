# Introduction

The stories we are surround by and consume affect our attitudes and beliefs. These stories are how we make sense of the world. This suggests that the people who tell stories ultimately have great power in shaping society. Everything a designer does will be in support of telling stories and by extension, shape the world we inhabit.

> Storytelling has a long history as a mechanism of knowledge transfer and can be considered a rapid immersion in an experience. [1]

In this lesson, you will learn about key elements of story-telling, structural models, and will practice making your own story.
