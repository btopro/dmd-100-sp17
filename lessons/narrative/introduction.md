# Introduction

The stories we are surround by and consume affect our attitudes and beliefs through the transfer of knowledge. These stories are how we make sense of the world. This suggests that the people who tell stories ultimately have great power in shaping society. Everything a designer does will be in support of telling stories and by extension, shape the world we inhabit.

> Storytelling has a long history as a mechanism of knowledge transfer and can be considered a rapid immersion in an experience: One cannot experience time travel, but one can gain knowledge about the act of time travel through a rich compelling, and highly experiential story.

The goal of this lesson is not to teach you every facet and application of storytelling. Mastering this subject, as with most subjects, will take quite a long time. Instead, you will learn about common elements of story-telling, structural models, and methods for building stories that you can apply as a framework for just about everything you make in your design careers.

In this lesson, you will: 

1. Read, watch, and listen to lesson topics and case studies
2. Reading assignment quick responses
3. Activities
4. You will create and tell an interactive story of your design.
5. End-of-lesson course-wide discussion
