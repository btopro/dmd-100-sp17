# License

This course will contain materials that are governed by a variety of licenses. Content spans public domain, Creative Commons, and Copyrighted materials used under Teach Act protection. Please be aware that a single license cannot apply to the entire course due to license incompatibility. OER Schema, viewable in the HTML source code, makes reference licenses to make identification easier for software applications. This course is not finished production, and licences are still being applied to content. This file will be updated when this process is completed.
