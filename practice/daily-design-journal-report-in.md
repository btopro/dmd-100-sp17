# Daily Design Journal

In this activity, you will document at least one object each day for two weeks using your journal and pen or pencil. Keeping a sketchbook or journal with you is a useful habit for tracking observations and ideas. In this activity, we will use this practice to make observations about objects that are close to us every day.
