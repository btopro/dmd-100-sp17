# Object story

For this activity, you will be creating a short story about an object. Write a story (500 words minimum) from the objects perspective. Who does it interact with? Where is does the story take place? What conflict might arise?

This is a first draft, do not worry about making it perfect. When you have written the story, upload to the Studio for the other students to read.

##Steps to completion:

1. Choose an object that you have owned for at least two years.
2. Choose a [genre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_genres)
3. Include the following characters
  - Protagonist
  - Antagonist
4. Write a story. Use these structural components as a guide:
  - The world as it was
  - And then one day...
  - Raising the stakes
  - Moment of change
  - World as it is now

**Note:** These components are more of a checklist, and are not meant to always be used in chronological order.
