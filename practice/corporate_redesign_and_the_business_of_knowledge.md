# Corporate Redesign and the Business of Knowledge

Corporate Redesign and the Business of Knowledge \(p. 150-165\) in Design and Truth by Robert Grudin.

## **Writing prompt**

In this chapter, Grudin describes arguments over imbuing corporate free market endeavors with moral imperatives, one of which is truthfulness. He also draws correlations between communication of knowledge within a company and its health. He examines Google as a case study in corporate knowledge investment and makes the case for the Chief Knowledge Officer. Let's say you were hired, just as Grudin was, to be a consultant for a large company. In what situation would you make the case for a Chief Knowledge Officer? How would you try to convince the CEO to take the idea seriously?
