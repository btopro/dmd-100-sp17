## **Prompt**

In this chapters, Grudin talks about something he calls mental design, the ability to wrap a story or experience into a narrative for the purpose of understanding the world and healing from a traumatic event. He also posits that subjectivity \(bias\) is a form of unconscious design. Narratives help us confront bias, assumptions, and preconceptions. Think of a time when you had to confront a bias of your own. Describe the event. Who was involved and what did you learn?
