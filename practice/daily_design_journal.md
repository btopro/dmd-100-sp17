# Daily Design Journal

In this activity, you will document a least one object each day for two weeks. You have the option of using paper and pencil or digital tool like sites.psu.edu, Pinterest, or Tumblr. Keeping a sketchbook or journal with you is a useful habit for tracking observations and ideas. In this activity, we will use this practice to make observations about objects that are close to us every day.
