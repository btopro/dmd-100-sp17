# Measuring success

To measure success in a way that we can compare one to another, we must have a common understanding about what we mean by success and what we mean by measurement. Some key aspects of success are not overtly teachable, measurable, or relevant for everyone. Determining what success looks like is difficult, as the qualities of a successful student can be different in given contexts. Therefore, to have a universal measurement system that works to any degree of accuracy often means that objective and quantifiable metrics are chosen over subjective and qualitative metrics â€“ and the former of which may be poor indicators of success for a multifaceted design program. These are our design constraints for assessment in this course.

In many educational institutions, the grade point average (GPA) measures a student's ability to meet the success metrics as set by an instructor or governing assessment entity. It is possible that there is correlation between GPA and success post graduation, but a high GPA does not guarantee a person will get a job, become well-rounded, or be prepared for the unexpected challenges ahead. Capable design students have the following attributes:
 
 1. Adaptability
   - shift mental models to approach problems differently
   - rapidly identify and learn required knowledge 
 2. Understanding
   - explore multiple perspectives
   - deconstruct
   - contextualize
 3. Focus
   - prioritize essential tasks
   - awareness of capabilities
 4. Perseverance
   - iterate to the best result within constraints
   - apply time an energy
 5. Skill
   - what you can do
