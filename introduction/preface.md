# Preface

This OER book contains design topics, exercises, and assignments to help a multi-domain digital designer better understand the complex systems in which humans attempt to solve problems and put new things into the world. That isn't meant to sound lofty, it's meant to communicate the notion that design bears an important responsibility to make the world a better place, not a worse place.

The course is developed as Open Education Resources \(OER\) at Penn State University as part of the [Digital Multimedia Design Program](http://dmd.psu.edu). This means that it is designed to be accessed by anyone, reused, or modified. I've also used a variety of content, from Copyrighted excerpts from books and other publications to Public Domain material, and many licenses between. This make's it rather impossible to print this book to re-sell, but is appropriate to use for teaching.
