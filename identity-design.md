# Identity design

Humans spend the majority of their time doing impression management, that is, managing the impression you make on other people. This is done in a variety of ways, including the clothes you wear, the house you live in, the car you drive, and many other material aspects of living. In addition to consumer purchases, psychologists say there are six major traits that differentiate human minds.

> A century of psychology has identified six major dimensions of variation that predict human behavior and that are salient to us. These are the key individual differences that distinguish human minds. These are mental traits that can be measured with good reliability and validity, that are genetically heritable, and stable across the life span, that predict behavior across diverse settings and domains, \(school, work, leisure, consumption, and family life\), and that seem to be universal across cultures and even across many animal species. \[1\]

Identified with the acronym, **GOCASE**, each letter represents a different trait. **G** represents general intelligence, **O** represents openness to experience, **C** is for conscientiousness and self-control,  **A** is for agreeableness and kindness, **S** is for stability in emotion, and **E** is for extraversion. Your ability to understand a person based on those traits will give you a good idea about how they will behave in difference circumstances.
