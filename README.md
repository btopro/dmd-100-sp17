# DMD 100: Digital Multimedia Design Foundations

DMD 100 introduces concepts, skills, language and principles of practice in art and design, communication, and information sciences.

With the aid of a standard design process, we walk through methods, tools, and mental attitudes necessary to approach ambiguous problems. This course is not meant to be a comprehensive design process catalog, but instead should inspire and build confidence in the act of design.

This course hopes to provide a "frame" for the things that you go on to make, design, and impact in terms of systems, storytelling, and ...

In this course, tools include software, hardware, and the strategies that encourage empathetic understanding of problems and issues.
