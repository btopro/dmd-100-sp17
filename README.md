# DMD 100: Digital Multimedia Design Foundations

DMD 100 introduces concepts, skills, language and principles of practice in art and design, communication, and information sciences.

With the aid of a standard design process, we walk through methods, tools, and mental attitudes necessary to approach ambiguous problems. This course is not meant to be a comprehensive design process catalog, but instead should inspire and build confidence in the act of design.
