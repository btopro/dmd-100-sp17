# Discover: Journey Map
 A journey map is great way to visualize an entire process
 
 
 **For example:**
  1. I realized the grass was long
  2. I decided to mow the lawn with my lawnmower
  3. I walked to the garage
  4. There were many objects in the way that I had to move
  5. I pulled the lawnmower out of the garage
  6. I checked to see that it had gasoline - it was low
  7. I poured gasoline into the lawnmower
  8. I started to mow the grass
  9. I disliked mowing the lawn because the process is time consuming
  10. I emptied the grass clippings many times during the process
  11. I eventually finished and put the lawnmower back into the garage
  12.
