# Discover: Journey Map

A journey map is great way to visualize an entire process of an interaction. By visualizing each step, you will better understand the nuances of an experience.

**Example steps for a journey map: Mowing the lawn**

1. One week passes since the lawn was mowed last
2. The grass grew longer than the local township ordinance allows
3. I realized the grass was too long.
4. I decide to mow the lawn with my lawnmower.
5. I open the garage
6. I take the lawnmower out of the garage.
7. I check to see that it had enough gasoline - it was low.
8. I fill the fuel tank with gasoline.
9. I start to mow the grass.
10. I stopped to get a drink of water halfway through, because I was dehydrated.
11. I emptied the grass clippings many times during the process.
12. I eventually finished and put the lawnmower back into the garage.
13. I contemplate the Sisyphean process of lawn-care
