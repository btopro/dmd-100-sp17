# Discover: Journey Map

A journey map is great way to visualize an entire process of an interaction. By visualizing each step, you will better understand the nuances of an experience.

**Example steps for a journey map: Mowing the lawn**

1. The grass grew longer than the local township ordinance allows
2. I realized the grass was too long.
3. I decided to mow the lawn with my lawnmower.
4. I walked to the garage and waited for the automatic door to lift.
5. There were many objects in the way that I had to move.
6. I pulled the lawnmower out of the garage.
7. I checked to see that it had gasoline - it was low.
8. I poured gasoline into the lawnmower
9. I started to mow the grass, and made a lot of noise
10. I emptied the grass clippings many times during the process
11. I stopped to get a drink of water halfway through, because I was dehydrated.
12. I thought about how I disliked mowing the lawn because the process is time consuming, dirty, and noisy
13. I eventually finished and put the lawnmower back into the garage, and moved the objects back as they were
14. I closed the garage door
15. I contemplate the Sisyphean process of lawn-care
