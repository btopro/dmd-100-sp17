# Organizing story development

You do not need to follow these in any particular order. Choose the path of least resistance when quickly prototyping a narrative.

## Character

1. Choose a genre
2. Define the audience
3. Identify characters
  1. Assign characterization types to characters
  2. Develop character profiles
  3. Identify tropes to apply to characters or change characters to avoid unwanted tropes

## Plot

1. Map critical beats


## Structure

1. Choose a model
  - It helps to sketch on paper
2.   

## Media
1. Types
  - Single media source
    - There are too many types of media to list here, but any method of communicating to a person is a type of media. For the purposes of this topic, an interactive digital hypertext narrative (a website with links) will be the type of media used to provide an experience for viewers of your story.
  - **Trans-media:** Trans-media refers to the idea that a narrative is communicated and experienced across multiple forms of media. A good example of a trans-media narrative project is documented in the film, [The Institute (2013)](http://www.theinstitutemovie.com). In the film, fictional and non-fiction stories unfold through a wide array of media including paper fliers, physical installations and puzzles, radio programs, organized events, video recordings, phone calls, and others.
