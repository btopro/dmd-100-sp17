# Organizing story development

Story development is a generative process where ideas, themes, and unique characteristics tend to surface through iteration and reflection. It is also a technical process, where common elements are added subtracted, combined, and transformed to convey meaning, encourage insights, and intensify excitement.

## Process

"Show, don't tell." When drafting a story, it is often best to convey information and ideas indirectly. For instance, you could write, "Mary was a very nice person." Alternatively, you could write, "Mary spent her weekends volunteering at a local shelter and worked part time as a nurse."

## Story Elements

### Setting

### Point of view (PoV)

### Character

1. Assign characterization types to characters
2. Develop character profiles
3. Identify tropes to apply to characters or change characters to avoid unwanted tropes

### Plot

1. Theme
2. Write critical beats (decision points)
  - Supports critical story path
  - Include elements:
    - Exposition
    - Conflict
    - Resolution 
2. Write optional beats.
  -  These become possible branches in your narrative.


### Structure

1. Choose or design a structure model
  - Should support critical story path and desired supplemental story interaction
  - Linear or non-linear?
2. 

## Media
1. Types
  - **Single source media**
    - There are too many types of media to list here, but any method of communicating to a person is a type of media. For the purposes of this topic, an interactive digital hypertext narrative (a website with links) will be the type of media used to provide an experience for viewers of your story.
  - **Trans-media:** Trans-media refers to the idea that a narrative is communicated and experienced across multiple forms of media. A good example of a trans-media narrative project is documented in the film, [The Institute (2013)](http://www.theinstitutemovie.com). In the film, fictional and non-fiction stories unfold through a wide array of media including paper fliers, physical installations and puzzles, radio programs, organized events, video recordings, phone calls, and others.
