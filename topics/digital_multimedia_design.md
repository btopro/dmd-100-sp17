# Digital Multimedia Design

## Background

Design is now a relevant force in science, art, business, politics, technology, humanities, and other traditionally silo'd fields. Admittedly, this means that deciding how and what to teach a designer, particularly in a multi-domain program, becomes a rather daunting task. On July 01, 2012, Penn State University suspended a program called Science, Technology, and Society \(STS\)—an event embroiled in [controversy](http://onwardstate.com/2011/01/15/budget-crunch-hits-home-sts-program-recommendation-for-closure/)— just as [Harvard](http://sts.hks.harvard.edu/) initiated their own STS program. \[1\] Content of STS courses included historical contexts for technological, scientific, and social progress through history. These topics are relevant design because STS subject-matter is a deep-dive into the visible and invisible forces that shape design decisions, and consequently, the impacts of those design decisions on society. The DMD program intends to bring some of that important context into the curriculum, though it can never hope to replace supplemental studies into the STS field.

As you move through your academic career, you can and should explore aspects of design that you find exciting and fulfilling. However, keep in mind is that you—a maker—bear a responsibility to know about the implications of your work, and ultimately how human beings will be affected by it. In this degree program, you will examine design as it relates to digital tools and skills needed for story telling, products and artifacts, interaction and experiences, and the production and dissemination of knowledge.

DMD 100 will exposed you to a broad perspective on design so that you can apply it as a conceptual _frame_ for your studies. In other words, even though you will be studying content not specifically talking about design, you will be able to understand the relationships of what you are learning in the larger context of design. After you complete DMD 100 and your other prescribed courses, enroll in other courses available to you within the approved major list as well as additional elective courses that you are interested in.

In DMD 300, you will apply your experiences from previous coursework to narrow your focus and interests while producing projects in collaboration with your peers. DMD 400 is the capstone course, where you will create an entirely self-directed design project for inclusion in an online exhibition of work.

## Mission

The Digital Multimedia Design Program promotes the value of imagination and creativity as human resources. **Digital** media generally refers to the storage and transmission of information in increasingly varied **multimedia** digital formats and devices, and within a changing array of modes of communication. **Design** is a means by which we respond to change in a purposeful way. By focusing on critical issues and opportunities, designers develop plans for taking innovative and strategic actions. Hence digital design shapes and impacts the physical and virtual spaces people inhabit. Over the course of this program, you will produce projects that stimulate sound habits of mind, develop proficiencies of practice, and foster critical sensibilities for addressing issues.

## DMD Core

The program is comprised of three program-exclusive spine courses and six prescribed (required) "core" courses – two from each contributing college; Arts & Architecture, Communications, and Information Sciences & Technology. The core courses will provide skills and context pertinent to the disciplines from which they reside. The spine courses provide opportunities to frame and combine experiences from these disciplines.

## Pathways

Though design is part of the core identity of the program, each student will develop their own pathway. A pathway is literally a sequence of courses. However, you have great control over choosing which courses to combine into your sequence. To help you get started, there are pre-made course sequences available on the DMD Program Hub.

## Projects

Over time, you will develop capabilities necessary to use digital technologies in multimedia projects. DMD 100 projects are designed for students with limited knowledge of digital production technology, but introduces foundational design knowledge that can be applied to frame all future DMD coursework. Final projects in the capstone course will be made available as part of an online exhibition.

## Portfolios

Developing a creative digital portfolio of work that showcases your interest areas and capabilities will become an essential component for professional development.
