# Digital Multimedia Design

The Digital Multimedia Design Program promotes the value of imagination and creativity as human resources. Over the course of this program, you will produce projects that stimulate sound habits of mind, develop proficiencies of practice, and foster critical sensibilities when addressing issues.

Though design is part of the core identity of the program, each student will develop their own education pathway, more clearly identifying creative interest areas along the way.
