# Interaction Design IxD

Designing for interaction is the process of understanding, accounting for, and sometimes altering a user(s) mental model (what they know and how they think) to facilitate a dialogue between that user and object, system, or event. This does not have to be software. You could be designing an interview between two people by providing a questions menu designed to draw out insights, a voting ballot that eliminates voter confusion and errors, or a new input device for virtual reality. 

To design an interaction, a designer must seek to know:

- Goals of the interaction
- User's constraints, knowledge, and experiences
- Where and how it will happen
- Constraints of the environment it's happening in
- How the interaction went
