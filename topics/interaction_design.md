# Interaction Design

Designing for interaction is the process of understanding, accounting for, and sometimes altering a user(s) mental model (what they know and how they think) to facilitate a dialogue between that user and a system.

To design an interaction, a designer must seek to know:

- Goals of the interaction
- User's constraints, knowledge, and experiences
- Where and how it will happen
- Constraints of the environment it's happening in
- How the interaction went
