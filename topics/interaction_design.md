# Interaction Design \(IxD\)

Designing for interaction is the process of understanding, accounting for, and sometimes altering a user\(s\) mental model \(what they know and how they think\) to facilitate a dialogue between that user and object, system, or event. This does not have to be software. You could be designing an conversation between two people by providing discussion topics, a voting ballot to reduce voter confusion and errors, or a new device to make virtual reality feel more like physical reality.

> ... changes will be realized by designers, and by a specific breed of designers: those creative designers who are both artists and engineers and who are able to balance, over an extended period of time, technology and aesthetics without ever losing sight of the most important facet of design: humanity. \[3\]

To design an interaction, a designer must seek to know:

* True goals of the interaction \(this is sometimes different than stated goals\)
* User's constraints and mental model
* Where and how it will happen
* Constraints of the environment it's happening in
* How the interaction went

## Flow

Flow was named by Mihály Csíkszentmihályi, a Hungarian psychologist. Flow is a kind of mental state where a person is completely immersed in concentration and focus when doing something.

## Behavior

Nudging.

## Interaction Principles

In the computer engineering field, there are five standard interaction principles that software developers refer to when building an effective graphical user interface, otherwise known as a **GUI** \(pronounced gooey\) . They dictate that an interface must be perceivable, predictable, learnable, consistent, and provide feedback to the user.

### Perceivable

Being perceivable means that a person, who has no prior knowledge must be able to sense and understand an object or interface in some way.

### Predictable

Human's rely on predictions to navigate the world. An unpredictable environment can be frustrating, scary, and in some cases dangerous.

### Learnable

### Consistent

Elements that perform the same action should look and function the same way. This not only refers to visual and physical elements, but also to sound, language, and conceptual organization.

### Feedback
