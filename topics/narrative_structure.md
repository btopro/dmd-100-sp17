# Narrative Structure

A narrative structure orders or disorders the events of a story for the audience. There are commonly used frameworks for storytelling which started with Aristotle's three part structure which consists of a beginning, middle, and end.

Hollywood films tend to have structural models that traditionally sell well in the box office, increasing the probability that they will see a return on the production investment. The perception is that experimental or uncommon narrative structures tend to be risky. The same can be said for large game developers who are inclined to produce sequels of high selling titles.

This can explain why many of the novel or boundary-pushing films tend to come from independent authors and screenwriters, indie game developers, indie filmmakers, and so on.

## Dramatic structure

Gustav Freytag (1816 - 1895), a German dramatist and novelist, developed the structure for the way stories are told in ancient Greek and Shakespearean drama. This analysis is known as Freytag's analysis, dramatic structure, or Freytag's Pyramid. His analysis consisted of the following parts:

1. exposition
2. rising action
3. climax
4. falling action
5. d√©nouement/resolution

This five act structure works well when describing Greek and Shakespearean plays. ~~Contemporary film narratives include these components, but apply them liberally throughout narrative.~~

Almost all Hollywood films, Shakespearean plays, and Greek and Roman Mythologies align with the the following linear structures:

- Three Act Structure
- Five Act Structure
- Hero's Journey

### Non-linear narrative structures
A non-linear structure is not necessarily chronological or cause and effect based. Story is unfolded simultaneously and recursively.

### Interactive narrative
The story-line in an interactive narrative work is not predetermined. The story is constructed based on a viewer's choices real-time. Games that use this structure often rely on sophisticated AI software to construct the environment around these choices.

#### Decision nodes
An interactive narrative is comprised of decision or action points called nodes, where the user impacts the unfolding of the narrative by making a choice or performing an action. The choice the user makes can determine which branching narrative path is taken. The decisions themselves are part of the plot, which handles dramatization of the events.

For example, let's say you are playing a hypertext narrative, and your character is a young woman who sees a hooded figure shoplifting. The options to proceed include a) tell the shopkeeper, b) follow the shoplifter, or c) do nothing. Depending on which choice you select, the story may unfold in three different ways.

#### Critical story path 

A critical story path can be thought of as the shortest path possible through a series of decision nodes to complete the interactive story.

To develop the critical path:

1. All the critical story beats must be accounted for
2. Determine essential actions and decisions
3. Identify the optional narrative interactions that build around the central story

#### Linear narrative structural models
##### Branching

The branching structure is the structure used in choose your own adventure books and most interactive narratives. One problem with branching structures is the tendency to create overly complicated story paths.

##### String of pearls

In this linear structure, a user must complete node's requirements to continue to the next node.

##### Hero's journey

![Hero's Journey Strucutre](../narrative-journey-structure.png)
In the linear structure, a user would follow the twelve stages of the hero's journey. However, there can be fewer or additional stages and still be considered a journey structure.

##### Parallel worlds

![Parallel Structure](../narrative-parallel-structure.png)

In this quasi-linear structure, users are given the opportunity to explore multiple story-lines running in parallel. There is typically no way to experience all of the stories at once, though they may intersect at opportune times.

##### Drill-down
![Drill-down structure](../narrative-drill-down-structure.png)

This bi-linear structure encourages users to move through a story vertically and laterally, where lateral movement represents plot points and vertical movement represents the gathering information and details surrounding the plot.

#### Non-linear structural models

##### Sandbox or open-world


![Sandbox Structure](../narrative-sandbox-structure.png)


A sandbox structure is one where the story unfolds based on how a player chooses to interact in what is typically a large, open environment. This is a loose structure where the setting of the story often becomes central to the experience.

##### Graph
![Graph structure](../narrative-graph-structure.png)
A graph structure is where all nodes simultaneously connect with every other node bi-bidirectionally. Discerning a narrative thread in just a structure can be difficult.

#### Creating your own structural model

It is quite possible that no good pattern exists for the kind of story you want to create. Part of the creative process for writing a narrative is producing the framework that can best support your story.
