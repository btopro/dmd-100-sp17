# Concept development
## Choosing an issue
The issue, otherwise known as the theme, is the impetus for writing a story in the first place. This should be based on a topic that you are passionate about and interested in exploring.

## Deconstructing the issue
In a constructivist perspective, everything is made of smaller parts, and figuring out what those parts are can lead to moments of insight. You can figure out what the parts are by describing the subject and how it functions in more general, or abstract language.

## Contextualization
Now that you have deconstructed the issue at hand, it is time to apply the insights to plausible scenarios and expressions of possible solutions.

## Formal presentation
Form refers to shape of the idea's expression. Whether written, visual, or physically constructed, you give your audience a method for engaging with your ideas. Refer to the formal constraints of the project for details.
