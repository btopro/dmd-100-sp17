From the moment a person wakes up, they are interacting with design. Everything in the home, place of work, and journey to and from has been influenced by a designer. The degree of care for each designed artifact or experience can vary dramatically, giving people a range of experience - from a sense delight to intense dismay. Design as a field of practice has become more inclusive since the days of the Bauhaus, as people, businesses, and institutions have begun recognize the impact that the design process can have for successful and positive outcomes in solving complex and ambiguous problems.

## Design at scale

Design can happen at every scale. At the small scale, humans can collide single atoms together to investigate theoretical physics or to create very large bombs. At the large scale, complex social and technological systems can impact the global climate affecting every living organism on Earth. Understanding the scale you are designing for will have many implications for your process and design outcomes. Systems thinking plays an essential role when designing for large scale, as there are many forces that will affect your design that are out of your control.
