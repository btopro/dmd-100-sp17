# What is Design?

## Introduction

Design has had many definitions. At the broadest sense of the word as a verb, it can be thought of the act of making a choice. In the broadest sense as a noun, design is the result of a choice. More specifically, design serves as a process to select and organize elements to satisfy an intention. Design tends not to be performed arbitrarily.

From the moment a person wakes up, they are interacting with design. Everything in the home, place of work, and journey to and from has been influenced by a designer. The degree of care for each designed artifact or experience can vary dramatically, giving people a range of experience - from a sense delight to intense dismay. Design as a field of practice has become more inclusive since the days of the Bauhaus, as people, businesses, and institutions have begun recognize the impact that the design process can have for successful and positive outcomes in solving complex and ambiguous problems.
