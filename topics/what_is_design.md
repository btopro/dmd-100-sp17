# What is Design?

## Introduction

> “The primary function of design is to shape and channel energy.”

From the moment you wake up, you are interacting with design. Everything in the home, place of work, and journey to and from has been influenced by a designer of some kind. The degree of care for each designed artifact or system can vary dramatically, causing you to experience delight, dismay, and everything in between. As design moved out of the basement and into the boardroom, the design field has grown larger in scope, and has become a tool for civic engagement and change. Design is now a relevant force for good in science, art, business, technology, humanities, and other traditionally silo'd fields, and this means that deciding what and how to teach a designer, particularly in a multi-domain program, becomes a rather daunting feat of pedagogical alchemy. It is this reason that you have been asked to read a book that talks about design from a philosophical and social perspective. As you move through your academic studies, you can and should deep dive into aspects of design that you find exicting and fulfilling. In this degree program, you will examine design as it relates to digital tools and skills needed for story telling, products and artefacts, interaction and experiences, and the production and dissemination of knowledge.

Jess McMullin describes a continuum of design maturity in his model, called _A Rough Design Maturity Continuum._ In the model, five stages range from having no strategic design to using design for identifying and framing central challenges and opportunities.

1. No conscious design
2. Style
3. Function and Form
4. Problem solving
5. Framing

At the broadest sense of design as a verb, it can be thought of the act of making a choice. In the broadest sense of _design as a noun_, it is the result of a choice. For the purposes of this course, **design is the process that helps a person or group create, select, modify, and organize elements to satisfy an intended outcome**. However, this definition does not define good design. A quick Internet search will reveal many ways of defining good design.

## Good design in list form

Dieter Rams, a famous industrial designer, has written a rather famous list of what makes for good product design. It follows:

1. Good design is innovative
2. Good design makes a product useful
3. Good design is aesthetic
4. Good design makes a product understandable
5. Good design is unobtrusive
6. Good design is honest
7. Good design is long lasting
8. Good design is thorough down to the last detail
9. Good design is environmentally friendly
10. Good design is as little design as possible

On page 29 in _Design and Truth_, Robert Grudin assembles a slightly longer list:

1. Good design is in accord with nature and human nature
2. Good design is in harmony with its immediate surroundings
3. Good design converses with contingent technologies
4. Good design helps to develop skill and/or imparts knowledge
5. Good design extends a user's sensibilities and freedom
6. Good design projects simplicity
7. Good design minimizes difficulties and dangers
8. Good design conveys a sense of beauty
9. Good design gives pleasure to use
10. Good design is not unreasonably expensive
11. Good design is sustainable
12. Good design allows a user to perform optimally in engaging reality
13. Good design can be delivered, installed, and repaired conveniently

These lists were not meant to be hard rules that apply to everything, but they can be helpful guidelines when making or evaluating design. Unfortunately, these lists do little to explain the process behind good design work.
