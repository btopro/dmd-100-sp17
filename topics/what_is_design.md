From the moment a person wakes up, they are interacting with design. Everything in the home, place of work, and journey to and from has been influenced by a designer of some kind. The degree of care for each designed artifact or experience can vary dramatically, giving people a range of experiences - from delight to dismay. Design as a field of practice has become more inclusive since the days of the Bauhaus as people, and in turn, has become harder to define.

At the broadest sense of design as a verb, it can be thought of the act of making a choice. In the broadest sense as a noun, design is the result of a choice. For the purposes of this course, design can be thought of as a process that helps a person select and organize elements to satisfy an intention.
