# Critical thinking

Critical thinking is not the rote memorization and retention of information. Instead, you can think of critical thinking as the capabilities and competencies required for generating and processing information to evaluate, judge, and guide future actions. It's aim to achieve the best possible outcome for a given situation.

> Critical thinking is, in short, self-directed, self-disciplined, self-monitored, and self-corrective thinking. It requires rigorous standards of excellence and mindful command of their use. It entails effective communication and problem solving abilities and a commitment to overcome our native egocentrism and sociocentrism.

>â€“ *Richard Paul Linda Elder* [1]

Critical thinking is a rational and intellectual endeavor. Someone practiced in critical thinking can make well-constructed arguments, locate logical fallacies, connect ideas to draw conclusions, and identify bias. A critical thinker without ethical integrity would seek to manipulate others for the sake of their own benefit.
