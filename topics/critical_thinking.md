# Critical thinking

To understand what critical thinking is, it may be best to try to describe what it isn't. Critical thinking is not the rote memorization and retention of information. It is not the acquisition and use of skills without the contextual awareness of outcomes. Instead, it refers to capabilities and competencies required for generating and processing information for the purpose of evaluation, judgment, and guiding future actions.

> Critical thinking is, in short, self-directed, self-disciplined, self-monitored, and self-corrective thinking. It requires rigorous standards of excellence and mindful command of their use. It entails effective communication and problem solving abilities and a commitment to overcome our native egocentrism and sociocentrism.

>â€“ *Richard Paul Linda Elder* [1]

Critical thinking is a rational and intellectual endeavor. A critical thinker without ethical integrity would seek to manipulate others for the sake of their own benefit. From this point, we look Western Philosophy for insights on idealism and altruism.
