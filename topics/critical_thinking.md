# Critical thinking

Critical thinking is not the rote memorization and retention of information. Instead, you can think of critical thinking as the capabilities and competencies required for generating and processing information to evaluate, judge, and guide future actions. It's aim to achieve the best possible outcome for a given situation.

> Critical thinking is, in short, self-directed, self-disciplined, self-monitored, and self-corrective thinking. It requires rigorous standards of excellence and mindful command of their use. It entails effective communication and problem solving abilities and a commitment to overcome our native egocentrism and sociocentrism.

> – _Richard Paul Linda Elder_ \[1\]

Critical thinking is a rational and intellectual endeavor. Someone practiced in critical thinking can make well-constructed arguments, locate logical fallacies, connect ideas to draw conclusions, and identify bias. A critical thinker without ethical integrity would seek to manipulate others for the sake of their own benefit. One who is ignorant to critical thinking skills would be easy prey to such a person, thereby reinforcing critical thinking as a requisite work and life skill in any modern society. It is also an imperative skill for social, cultural, political, and technological leaders to guide society in a purposeful and beneficial way.

## Design blocks

A design block is a mental, cultural, or social hinderance to finding solutions that stray from norms and assumed knowledge and ideas. Without a willingness to push boundaries, change will be a very slow process.

> We live in a society that penalizes highly creative individuals for their non-conformist autonomy. This makes the teaching of problem-solving discouraging and difficult. A twenty-two-year-old student arrives at school with massive blocks against new ways of thinking, engendered by some sixteen years of miseducation, a heritage of childhood and pubescence of being "molded," "adjusted," "shaped." Meanwhile our society continuously evolves new social patterns that promise a slight departure from the mainstream but without ever endangering the patchwork of marginal groups that make up society as a whole.

Whether they are a subject-matter expert or a layperson, everyone faces implicit \(unconscious\) and explicit \(conscious\) biases that can cause misinterpretations, false assumptions, and an over-reliance on common and familiar paths to a solution. "That is the way it has always been done" or "it's just common sense" are common expressions used by someone who is operating with ingrained bias \(in this specific example, it's called confirmation bias\). A bias, like a design block, can undermine innovative problem solving and inhibit creative thinking. Modern design processes attempt to identify where bias may exist, and prevent it from harming the outcome.

On page 158 in Victor Papanek's _Design for the Real World, Human Ecology and Social  Change_, he lists seven types of blocks:

> We can list the inhibitors that keep us from solving tasks in new and innovative ways. They are:
>
> 1. Perceptual
> 2. Emotional
> 3. Associational
> 4. Cultural
> 5. Professional
> 6. Intellectual
> 7. Environmental

## Beginner's mindset

A designer's approach to questioning of assumptions, known as the beginners mindset, is helpful for bypassing stereotypes an misconceptions that often inhibit empathetic discoveries. How a person acquires the beginner's mindset can vary. Here is an example from the Hasso Plattner Institute of Design at Stanford: \[2\]

1. **Don’t judge.** Just observe and engage users without the influence of value judgments upon their actions, circumstances, decisions, or “issues.”
2. **Question everything.** Question even \(and especially\) the things you think you already understand. Ask questions to learn about how the user perceives the world. Think about how a 4-year-old asks “Why?” about everything. Follow up an answer to one “why” with a second “why.”
3. **Be truly curious.** Strive to assume a posture of wonder and curiosity, especially in circumstances that seem either familiar or uncomfortable.
4. **Find patterns.** Look for interesting threads and themes that emerge across interactions with users.
5. **Listen.** Really.

On page 172 in Victor Papanek's _Design for the Real World, Human Ecology and Social  Change_, he lists eight methods to eliminate blocks:

> Our job then becomes one of establishing methods of doing away with these blocks. Although it is difficult to make a definitive list, since there is enormous overlap between different methods, I shall list eight:
>
> 1. Brainstorming
> 2. Synectics
> 3. Morphological analysis
> 4. Sliding Scales
> 5. Bisociation
> 6. Trisociation
> 7. Bionics and Biomechanics
> 8. Forcing New Thinking Patterns
