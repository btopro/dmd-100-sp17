Design thinking generally refers to divergent and convergent thinking methods used to strategically guide a person or group to better understanding of complex problems – often by generating a large array of ideas and questioning underlying assumptions. There are a variety of individuals, institutions, and organizations that develop processes aimed at making these problems more solvable, thereby increasing the likelihood that a solution can be found. Some organizations include IDEO, Frog Design, Stanford D.School, etc.
