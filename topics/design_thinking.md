Design Thinking is the most current incarnation of terminology meant to frame and ascribe value for the role of design within a larger system. Generally speaking, design thinking refers the methods used to strategically guide a person or group to question underlying assumptions, generate a large array of ideas, better understand user needs, synthesize prototypes, propose or build viable solutions, and more. It's roots can be traced to Participatory Design, User-Centered Design, Service Design, and Human-Centered Design.

The value of design thinking comes from it's ability to deal in uncertainty. Critical design failures tend to occur when tried-and-true processes, procedures, and policies are applied to solve a problem in an environment that is undergoing change. In these environments, creative problem solving and innovation are needed to address change.
