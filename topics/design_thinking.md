Design Thinking is the most current incarnation of terminology meant to frame and ascribe value for the role of design within a larger system. Generally, Design Thinking refers the methods used to strategically guide a person or group to question underlying assumptions, generate a large array of ideas, better understand user needs, synthesize prototypes, and to propose or build viable solutions. It's roots can be traced to Participatory Design, User-Centered Design, Service Design, and Human-Centered Design.
