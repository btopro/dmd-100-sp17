# Why stories?
Let's investigate why storytelling might be important, and the role it plays in human history.

## Stories organize reality
In the talk, [The storytelling animal: Jonathan Gottschall at TEDxFurmanU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhd0XdedLpY), Jonathan Gottschall tells about the pervasive role stories play in the human experience. Storytelling is how humans organize reality and are able to communicate and interpret meaning. Reality is essentially organized by the storytellers of the world.

However, meaning cannot just be created and distributed en mass without some sort of filter. Human's have developed a filtering system hesitant against absorbing meaning – skepticism.  Skepticism is assuaged with the persuasive argument's appeal to logic (logos), emotions (pathos), and ethics (ethos). A bad story or a poorly delivered narrative presents us with what we can think of as a bad argument – that is that this story is not reasonable, I don't care about it, and it doesn't appeal to my sense of identity. What is reasonable, emotionally moving, and indicative of a someone's sensibilities can be specific to a point in history, from culture to culture, and from person to person.

Media companies have spent a lot of money to figure out how to deliver content to more people than ever before in human history. You can read, watch, interact with, or listen to a new story every day for the rest of your life. It's safe to assume that in the context of many business models, the meaning embedded in stories that are transmitted has become irrelevant to profit. Social media technology has enabled story-telling entities to now tell only the stories they think will be consumed by that person. If you and your neighbor have different ideas of what is real, what effects will this have on society at large? The people who create and disseminate stories have a tremendous amount of power. Stories, like other kinds of information, are power. To be a good storyteller is to have the power to shape the world. This is why storytellers are designers.

## Story and object

Semiotics, the study of meaning making, has produced models for describing how meaning is communicated; Saussure's dyadic model consists of the signifier and the signified, and Peirce's triadic model consists of a icons, indices, and symbols. Just like [Forest Gump's shoes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egkrxkiUnoo), objects are "sign vehicles," targets of mental acts that do [not have to be physical things](https://vimeo.com/133160620). From the perspective of storytelling, objects are the medium by which a story is told. Humans figured out how to do this with writing approximately 12,000 years ago.

> "The first examples of writing occurred in the Near East at the time when animals and plants were being domesticated. They took the form of clay tokens, smaller than an inch in size, used to represent different commodities." [1]

The significance of this event is that people could now ascribe meaning (in this case to count grain and livestock for trade) using abstract markings on clay tokens. The token was a standardized signifier, which made commerce possible in prehistoric times. Eventually, the desire to describe other types of information led to the development of a written language and number systems. Out of that arose complex social structures, division of labor, law, cities, property ownership, and other aspects of modern civilization.
