## Why stories?
In the talk, [The storytelling animal: Jonathan Gottschall at TEDxFurmanU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhd0XdedLpY), Jonathan Gottschall tells about the pervasive role stories play in the human experience. Storytelling is how humans organize reality and are able to communicate and interpret meaning. As a designer, you are organizing reality for the people around you. This is why storytelling is of such high importance.

To some degree, everything has a story, even [shoes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egkrxkiUnoo). Semiotics, the study of meaning making, has produced models for describing how meaning is communicated; Saussure's dyadic model consisting of signifier and the signified, and Peirce's Triadic model consisting of a icons, indices, and sylmbols. Just like Forest Gump's shoes, objects are sign vehicles.
