## Why stories?
In the talk, [The storytelling animal: Jonathan Gottschall at TEDxFurmanU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhd0XdedLpY), Jonathan Gottschall tells about the pervasive role stories play in the human experience. Storytelling is how humans organize reality and are able to communicate and interpret meaning. As a designer, you are organizing reality for the people around you. This is why storytelling is of such high importance.

To some degree, everything tells a story, even [shoes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egkrxkiUnoo). Semiotics, the study of meaning making, has produced models for describing how meaning is communicated; Saussure's dyadic model consisting of signifier and the signified, and Peirce's Triadic model consisting of a icons, indices, and symbols. Just like Forest Gump's shoes, objects (which do not have to be physical things) are "sign vehicles," or from the perspective of storytelling, the medium by which a story is told. Humans figured out how to do this with writing approximately 12,000 years ago.

"The first examples of writing occurred in the Near East at the time when animals and plants were being domesticated. They took the form of clay tokens, smaller than an inch in size, used to represent different commodities." [1]
