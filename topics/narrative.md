# Why stories?
Let's investigate why storytelling might be important, and the role it plays in human history.

## Stories organize reality
In the talk, [The storytelling animal: Jonathan Gottschall at TEDxFurmanU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhd0XdedLpY), Jonathan Gottschall tells about the pervasive role stories play in the human experience. Storytelling is how humans organize reality and are able to communicate and interpret meaning. Reality is essentially organized by the storytellers of the world.

However, meaning cannot just be created and distributed en mass without some sort of filter. Human's have developed a filtering system against absorbing meaning without hesitation, skepticism.  Skepticism is assuaged with the persuasive argument's appeal to logic (logos), emotions (pathos) and ethics (ethos). A bad story or a poorly delivered narrative presents us with what we can think of as a bad argument â€“ that is that this story is not reasonable, I don't care about it, and it doesn't appeal to my sense of identity. What is reasonable, emotionally moving, and indicative of a someone's sensibilities is specific to a point in history, from culture to culture, and from person to person.

## Story and object

Semiotics, the study of meaning making, has produced models for describing how meaning is communicated; Saussure's dyadic model consists of the signifier and the signified, and Peirce's triadic model consists of a icons, indices, and symbols. Just like [Forest Gump's shoes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egkrxkiUnoo), objects are "sign vehicles," targets of mental acts that do [not have to be physical things](https://vimeo.com/133160620). From the perspective of storytelling, objects are the medium by which a story is told. Humans figured out how to do this with writing approximately 12,000 years ago.

> "The first examples of writing occurred in the Near East at the time when animals and plants were being domesticated. They took the form of clay tokens, smaller than an inch in size, used to represent different commodities." [1]

The significance of this event is that people could now ascribe meaning (in this case to count grain and livestock for trade) using abstract markings on clay tokens. The token was a standardized signifier, which made commerce possible in prehistoric times. Eventually, the desire to describe other types of information led to the development of a written language and number systems. Out of that arose complex social structures, division of labor, law, cities, property ownership, and other aspects of modern civilization.
