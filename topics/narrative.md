## Why stories?
In the talk, [The storytelling animal: Jonathan Gottschall at TEDxFurmanU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhd0XdedLpY), Jonathan Gottschall tells about the pervasive role stories play in the human experience. Storytelling is how humans organize reality and are able to communicate and interpret meaning. As a designer, you are organizing reality for the people around you. This is why storytelling is of such high importance.

## Meaning making

Semiotics, the study of meaning making, has produced models for describing how meaning is communicated; Saussure's dyadic model consists of the signifier and the signified, and Peirce's triadic model consists of a icons, indices, and symbols. Just like [Forest Gump's shoes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egkrxkiUnoo), objects (which do not have to be physical things) are "sign vehicles," or from the perspective of storytelling, the medium by which a story is told. Humans figured out how to do this with writing approximately 12,000 years ago.

"The first examples of writing occurred in the Near East at the time when animals and plants were being domesticated. They took the form of clay tokens, smaller than an inch in size, used to represent different commodities." [1]

The significance of this event is that people could now ascribe meaning (in this case to count grain and livestock for trade) using abstract markings on clay tokens. The token was a standardized signifier, which made commerce possible in prehistoric times. Eventually, the desire to describe other types of information led to the development of a written language and number system. Out of that arose complex social structures, division of labor, law, cities, and property ownership.
