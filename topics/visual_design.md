## Elements of Visual Design

### Line
A line is a two dimensional element, often referred to as a mark.

- Implied: Sometimes the way two solid areas of color collide to form an implied line.
- Outlines: edge that defines the shape and space of a subject.
- Attributes of a line: Integrity (solid or broken), thickness, direction, complexity (straightness).

### Shape
- Geometric
- Organic

### Form

### Space

### Color
- Hue
  - Determined by the part(s) of the visible light spectrum
- Saturation/Intensity
  - Purity of a color
  - Brightness or dullness of a color
- Value
  - Lightness or darkness of a color

### Contrast
Two elements placed in close proximity with opposing qualities creates contrast. Constrast is often used to direct focus

### Texture
- Real
- Implied



## Formal analysis

When analyzing and critiquing visual work, there are three things to take into account that will make your feedback understandable by others:

1. Name the formal element
2. Describe what it is doing
3. Discuss the effect it has with respect to the entire work.
