## Deconstruction

What does it mean to **deconstruct** something? This term, not to be confused with destruct, seeks to unravel the thoughts, concepts, components, processes, and context that belies a work of art or design.

Physical deconstruction is a process where an object is taken apart and examined to get a better understanding of how it was put together and performs. An object that was put together and wasn't designed to come apart often incurs destruction and cannot be reassembled.

Conceptual deconstruction is the process by which you attempt to create a mental model, or a conceptual understanding of an object by focusing on breaking it down into smaller parts \(a constructivist approach\),
