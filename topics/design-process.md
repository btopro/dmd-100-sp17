# Design process

Depending on the industry a person works in, a set of contemporary best practices will be in fashion. If you don't know where to start, identifying, learning, and practicing those established guidelines makes good sense. If you are a seasoned designer, then adapting a process according to your own experiences is prudent, and something you would be used to doing. Innovating on a design process from the very start may be more inhibiting than helpful. For creative design production, there are a variety of models to choose from. In this course, we will be pulling from a design process model called the Double Diamond. The shape of a two-dimensional diamond shape, or a box turned to the sharp points are oriented

## Research

Almost any design process will have some form of research component. **Qualitative** research refers to open-ended and unstructured research that can be obtained through interviews, surveys, questionnaires, observation, and exploration. This type of data is descriptive and more difficult to analyze. **Quantitative** research deals in data that is measured and tends to be easier to process. Correlations, causal relationships, and trends interpreted from findings are subject to the researchers bias and assumptions.!
