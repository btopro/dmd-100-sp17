# Design process

Depending on the industry a person works in, a set of contemporary best practices will be in fashion. If you don't know where to start, identifying, learning, and practicing those established guidelines makes good sense. If you are a seasoned designer, then adapting a process according to your own experiences is prudent, and something you would be used to doing. Innovating on a design process from the very start may be more inhibiting than helpful. For creative design production, there are a variety of models to choose from. In this course, we will be adapted and simplifying a design process model called the Double Diamond, originally created by the British Design Council. The shape of a two-dimensional diamond is meant to be visual analogy describing the divergence and convergence of ideas. Read from left to right, you would use divergent thinking methods to create an array of possibilities, and then use convergent thinking methods to arrive as a specific outcome or decision.

## Double diamond

On the Double Diamond Phases diagram, you can see how two connected diamonds describe four phases, two divergent, and two convergent. The red arrows pointing away from each other represent divergence whereas the red arrows pointed towards each other represent convergence. In the first, left-most diamond, you would establish an understanding of the prompt and a solution plan. In the second, right-most diamond, you would construct the response to the prompt.

The **\(1\) Discover** phase is where you will gain a better understanding of the project's goals; the **\(2\) Define** phase is where you will narrow and form the project's direction; the **\(3\) Develop** phase is where you will explore production methodologies, prototype, and experiment; and finally the **\(4\) Deliver** phase is where you will iterate and refine your project.  This process model will be used to complete projects with an added discussion phase at the end. Though this process is not necessarily a linear methodology, we will be progressing through projects in a linear fashion.

## Research

Almost any design process will have some form of research component. **Qualitative** research refers to open-ended and unstructured research that can be obtained through interviews, surveys, questionnaires, observation, and exploration. This type of data is descriptive and more difficult to analyze. **Quantitative** research deals in data that is measured and tends to be easier to process. Correlations, causal relationships, and trends interpreted from findings are subject to the researchers bias and assumptions.
