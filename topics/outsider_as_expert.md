# Design blocks

Subject-matter experts are often plagued by biases that make them reliant on common and familiar paths to a solution. "That is the way it has always been done" or "it's just common sense" are typical phrases used by someone who has a kind of . A bias, also called a block, can undermine innovative problem solving and inhibit creative thinking.

In Victor Papanek's *Design for the Real World, Human Ecology and Social  Change*, he lists seven types of blocks:

1. Perceptual
2. Emotional
3. Associational
4. Cultural
5. Professional
6. Intellectual
7. Environmental

## Beginner's mindset

A designer's approach to questioning of assumptions, known as the beginners mindset, is helpful for bypassing stereotypes an misconceptions that often inhibit empathetic discoveries. How a person acquires the beginner's mindset can vary. Here is an example from the Hasso Plattner Institute of Design at Stanford:

1. **Don’t judge.** Just observe and engage users without the influence of value judgments upon their actions, circumstances, decisions, or “issues.”
2. **Question everything.** Question even (and especially) the things you think you already understand. Ask questions to learn about how the user perceives the world. Think about how a 4-year-old asks “Why?” about everything. Follow up an answer to one “why” with a second “why.”
3. **Be truly curious.** Strive to assume a posture of wonder and curiosity, especially in circumstances that seem either familiar or uncomfortable.
4. **Find patterns.** Look for interesting threads and themes that emerge across interactions with users.
5. **Listen.** Really.
