# Outsiders

An outsider is one that deals with a given issue or problem, but operates outside of a given system's existing standards for qualification and credibility. For instance, an outsider can be political candidate who has never served in politics, an untrained artist showing in galleries, or an unknown company that offers services that are disruptive to the established industry. Often times, an outsider has the unique ability to introduce innovative solutions.
