# Outsiders and the beginner's mindset

An outsider is one that deals with a given issue or problem, but operates outside of a given system's existing standards for qualification and credibility. For instance, an outsider can be political candidate who has never served in politics, an untrained artist showing in galleries, or an unknown company that offers services that are disruptive to the established industry.

Experts are often plagued by a cognitive bias that manifests as a reliance on common and familiar paths to a solution. This is why it can be possible for an outsider to introduce innovative solutions in long entrenched industries and markets – they are able to question the fundamental assumptions that experts know to be true. This questioning of assumptions is an essential design approach, known as the beginners mindset – helpful for bypassing stereotypes an misconceptions.

## Beginner's mindset

1. **Don’t judge.** Just observe and engage users without the influence of value judgments upon their actions, circumstances, decisions, or “issues.”
2. **Question everything.** Question even (and especially) the things you think you already understand. Ask questions to learn about how the user perceives the world. Think about how a 4-year-old asks “Why?” about everything. Follow up an answer to one “why” with a second “why.”
3. **Be truly curious.** Strive to assume a posture of wonder and curiosity, especially in circumstances that seem either familiar or uncomfortable.
4. **Find patterns.** Look for interesting threads and themes that emerge across interactions with users.
5. **Listen.** Really.
