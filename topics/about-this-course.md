# About this course

DMD 100: Digital Multimedia Design Foundations introduces design process and thinking skills to support and facilitate creative and reasoned approaches to ambiguous and ill-defined problem spaces. It introduces concepts, skills, language, and principles of practice related to art and design, communications, and information sciences. With the aid of a standard design process, we walk through methods, tools, and mental attitudes necessary to approach ambiguous problems. This course is not meant to be a comprehensive design process catalog, but instead should inspire and build confidence in the act of design.

## Course Structure

DMD 100 is comprised of 5 lessons that introduce design topics, approaches, and considerations. Each lesson will span one to 4 weeks depending on the semester. Students will read assigned chapters and course pages, review supplemental media including podcasts and videos, and complete design exercises employing the double-diamond method, culminating in a lesson project and critique. Students are expected to practice the design process throughout the course, and therefore will be assigned several activities a week to provide opportunity for practice and iteration.
