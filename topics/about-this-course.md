# Course Overview

DDMD 100 introduces concepts, skills, language, and principles of practice in art and design, communication, and information sciences. With the aid of a standard design process, we walk through methods, tools, and mental attitudes necessary to approach ambiguous problems. This course is not meant to be a comprehensive design process catalog, but instead should inspire and build confidence in the act of design.

DMD 100 Digital Multimedia Design Foundations sets a strong foundation of the design process and thinking skills to support and facilitate creative and reasoned approaches to ambiguous and ill-defined problem spaces related to the fields of art and design, communication, and information sciences. To prepare students for transformative design leadership roles, students will think, evaluate, and respond to local and global issues leveraging the digital medium and peer collaboration.

The course is primarily project-based, and students will complete a series of individual and collaborative exercises in which they apply design strategies and problem solving skills in multidisciplinary contexts to explore issues in creative production in digital media.
