# Course Overview

DMD 100 introduces concepts, skills, language, and principles of practice in art and design, communication, and information sciences. With the aid of a standard design process, we walk through methods, tools, and mental attitudes necessary to approach ambiguous problems. This course is not meant to be a comprehensive design process catalog, but instead should inspire and build confidence in the act of design.

DMD 100 Digital Multimedia Design Foundations sets a strong foundation of the design process and thinking skills to support and facilitate creative and reasoned approaches to ambiguous and ill-defined problem spaces related to the fields of art and design, communication, and information sciences. To prepare students for transformative design leadership roles, students will think, evaluate, and respond to local and global issues leveraging the digital medium and peer collaboration.

The course is primarily project-based, and students will complete a series of individual and collaborative exercises in which they apply design strategies and problem solving skills in multidisciplinary contexts to explore issues in creative production in digital media.

## Course Structure

This course is comprised of 5 lessons that introduce different design topics, approaches, and considerations. Generally, each lesson which will span a couple of weeks. Each lesson, students will read assigned chapters and course pages, review supplemental media including podcasts and videos, and complete design exercises employing the double-diamond method, culminating in a lesson project and critique. Students are expected to practice the design process throughout the course, and therefore will be assigned several activities a week to provide ample opportunity for practice and iteration.
