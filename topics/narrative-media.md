## Transmedia
Transmedia is communication of ideas and experiences through multiple mediums. But what exactly is a medium?

A medium is a carrier or vehicle of stuff, and in the case of creative work, concepts, ideas, and other expressions. If you are standing next to a person, and would like to communicate something you are thinking to them, you would simply use verbal communication, assuming you both spoke the same language. For a very long time, this was the main way humans communicated. Over time, people discovered that they could convey ideas without having to be physically present for the communication to take place. Written language allowed people to communicate an idea repeatedly, to different people, without having to be there.

Fast forward to now, we can use different media simultaneously to communicate. When one thing is being communicated across media, this is called Transmedia. Typically, each medium used adds to, expands, contextualizes content in different ways in a non-linear fashion.
