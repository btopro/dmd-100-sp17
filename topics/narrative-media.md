# Narrative media

A medium is a carrier or vehicle of stuff, and in the case of creative work, concepts, ideas, and other expressions. If you are standing next to a person, and would like to communicate something you are thinking to them, you would simply use verbal communication, assuming you both spoke the same language. For a very long time, this was the main way humans communicated. Over time, people discovered that they could convey ideas without having to be physically present for the communication to take place. Written language allowed people to communicate an idea repeatedly, to different people, without having to be there.

Fast forward to now, digital formats now afford people communicate across the planet by talking into a box that fits into the palm of your hand. [Some are working on brain interfaces](http://waitbutwhy.com/2017/04/neuralink.html) so that communication of thoughts can happen automatically and without the possible constraints imposed by spoken and written language.

## Analog and digital

Before the advent of microprocessors, capturing visual information was a laborious process that required master drawing and painting skills. However, that all changed in the 1830's when a French artist and chemist Louis-Jacques-Mandé Daguerre patented the Daguerreotype. The Daguerreotype extended that ability of a Camera Obscura–a large structure that allows light in through a pinhole, projecting the exterior scene onto an interior surface–by chemically recording the images onto metal plates.

## Transmedia

Transmedia is communication of ideas and experiences through multiple mediums. But what exactly is a medium?

A medium is a carrier or vehicle of stuff, and in the case of creative work, concepts, ideas, and other expressions. If you are standing next to a person, and would like to communicate something you are thinking to them, you would simply use verbal communication, assuming you both spoke the same language. For a very long time, this was the main way humans communicated. Over time, people discovered that they could convey ideas without having to be physically present for the communication to take place. Written language allowed people to communicate an idea repeatedly, to different people, without having to be there.

Fast forward to now, we can use different media simultaneously to communicate. When one thing is being communicated across media, this is called Transmedia. Typically, each medium used adds to, expands, contextualizes content in different ways in a non-linear fashion.

Unlike single-source media, **transmedia** refers to the idea that a narrative is communicated and experienced across multiple forms of media. A good example of a transmedia narrative project is documented in the film, [The Institute \(2013\)](http://www.theinstitutemovie.com). In the film, fictional and non-fiction stories unfold through a wide array of media including paper fliers, physical installations and puzzles, radio programs, organized events, video recordings, phone calls, and others.

## Interactive media

Interactive media is communication that you can influence or control in some way. In some cases, the viewer becomes the co-author of the communication by adding their own content. One of the most notable examples of interactive fiction is video games. Most, but not all, video games follow linear stories where players perform actions to move the story forward.

### Hypertext

An early computing pioneer, Theodor H. Nelson, summed up hypertext as this:“ by hypertext, I mean non-sequential writing—text that branches and allows choices to the reader, best read at an interactive screen. As popularly conceived, this is a series of text chunks connected by links, which offer the reader different pathways.”

The World Wide Web \(WWW\) was revealed on April 30th, 1990 at CERN by British Scientist Tim Berners-Lee, to make use of Internet available. The WWW, or simply "Web," allows for the use of Hyper Text Transfer Protocol \(HTTP\) to quickly and reliably retrieve and distribute information between a Web Browser and a Web Server.

Not long after, people started using hypertext as a means to tell stories, called hypertext narratives. Michael Joyce's Afternoon, written in 1987 and published by [Eastgate Systems](http://www.eastgate.com/) in 1991, is considered one of the first hypertext fictions. Hypertext fiction confronts readers with nodes of text; decision points where they use hypertext links to navigate to other nodes. Because the order in which the story is revealed will depend on reader choices, reader becomes–in a sense–co-author.

Hypertext fictions were first published using software such as [Storyspace](http://www.eastgate.com/storyspace/) and [Hypercard](http://hypercard.org/). Hypertext fiction is similar to to Choose Your Own Adventure books. 



### Hypermedia

## Examples

Because story is ubiquitous to the human experience, you find it embedded in every creative job or endeavor.

## Entertainment

**Films, novels, drawings and paintings, comic books, and games** are products that tell a story to highlight a moral or ethical quandary, contribute to discourse on a popular or marginalized subject, function a teaching tool, entertain, illuminate, etc.

** Podcasts** often combine journalism techniques and creative sound editing to disseminate knowledge and promote empathy.

## Product and service design:

**Graphic designers** use visual design elements to communicate simple ideas like how to use a voting ballot to abstract ideas like a company's brand identity.

**Industrial design** use visual and sculptural elements to communicate what a product does and how it's used.

**Design thinking** sessions are team-based work sessions where problems are identified and quick prototypes are generated. Story can help team members empathize with the audience to create a better product or service and recognize new ways of approaching solutions.

**Architecture** uses form and dimension of space and structure to tell the story of how people should use space, creating places for rest or work and all other aspects of sheltered human interaction.

## Journalism:

Local news stations tell stories associated with the communities the are embedded within.

National news stations tell stories associated with national and global interests.

Newspapers, magazines, blogs, and other publications combine photography, video, and investigative reporting techniques to communicate information about events.

## Governance:

**Politicians** use stories to gain public support for proposed policies.

**Activists** use signage, music, song, dance, and other types of performance to communicate their stories to the general public.
