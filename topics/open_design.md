# Open design

Distinct features of open design include a variety of attributes counter to the way most design happens. **Access** to open design is made _available_, _sharable_, and _licensed_ under open access terms. For access to be open, it cannot be _concealed_, _protected_, or _licensed_ under a fee or payment structure. For instance, Apple, Inc. is highly secretive about their projects until they are released to the public. The Linux operating system project is a good example of a Transparent-box design, where development and functionality is exposed. Open design helps others contribute by using _common digital notation language_ to specify **blueprints **and plans. The use of _proprietary_ notation language for specification does not contribute to openness. An example of an open specification language can be found at [Schema.org](/schema.org), where a community of developers promote structured data for the Internet. Open design is _reconfigurable_ and _extendable_ enabling **derivatives**, whereas design that is not open is _black-boxed_ or _fixed_, preventing derivatives from being possible. Open design is _reproducible_ and **not exclusive** or _limited to a finite series_. In contrast, _one-offs_ are not compatible with open design. Open design can be fabricated by commercial, off-the-shelf, multi-purpose machines giving everyone a **means of production**. If the design must be fabricated by a skilled artisan or if it requires custom built machines or moulds, then it is not open. The **manufacturing process** of open design is subject to distributed and scalable production. A _centrally controlled_ and _preset batch production_ process is not open design. Open design has _generative_ qualities giving it whereas closed design does not have this potential, and is _close-ended_. \[1\]

Notable projects include [openstructures.net](/openstructures.net), [wikihouse.cc](/wikihouse.cc) and [opensourceecology.org](/opensourceecology.org), which hope to use the power of open source technology with crowdsource design communities to enable the average person to create houses, products, and sustainable living environments.

## Open source

**Open source** consists of projects open to modification by an engaged community of developers.

## Open innovation

**Open innovation** refers to organizations that demonstrate a large amount of transparency and discourse in their design process. One notable organization is Mozilla, chronicling their [open branding initiative](https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/) and requesting advice and guidance from the greater design community. Every year, IKEA hosts [Democratic Design Day](http://ouryear.ikea.com/2015/design/a-day-dedicated-to-democratic-design/), an event set up by the marketing director where customers can engage in conversation with designers and glimpse into their future product lines.

## Open Design Power Values

| Old | New |
| --- | --- |
| Managerialism, institutionalism, representative governance | Informal, opt-in decision making, self-organization, networked governance |
| Exclusivity, competition, authority, resource consolidation | Open source collaboration, crowd wisdom, sharing |
| Discretion, confidentiality, separation between private and public spheres | radical transparency |
| Professionalization, specialization | Do-it-ourselves, maker culture |
| Long-term affiliation and loyalty, less overall participation | Short-term, conditional affiliation, more overall participation |
