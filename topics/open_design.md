# Open design

The main difference between traditional "closed door" or "black box" style of design is that the process is obscured. For instance, Apple, Inc. is highly secretive about projects until they are released to the public.

## Democratic design

Democratic design is highly debated in the design world. There is disagreement between designers that it is even possible to design in a democratic fashion and disagreement of whether it would be a good idea if it is possible. Design-by-committee is a term that immediately comes to mind, which is a good democratic structure but unfortunately tends to ruin most design projects. Open design and democratic design share similar values, but there seems to be strange uses of the word democratic.

### Quick IKEA case study

See this IKEA blog post about [Democratic Design Day](http://ouryear.ikea.com/2015/design/a-day-dedicated-to-democratic-design/), an event set up by the marketing director, where customers get to see future products, which suggests they value transparency, but only for one day a year. No actual design happens on this day.

| Exclusivity, competition, authority, resource consolidation | Open source collaboration, crowd wisdom, sharing |
| Discretion, confidentiality, separation between private and public spheres | radical transparency |
| Professionalization, specialization | Do-it-ourselves, maker culture |
| Long-term affiliation and loyalty, less overall participation | Short-term, conditional affiliation, more overall participation |
