# Audience

When a car maker creates a car, there is quite a lot of design considerations, the major one of which is the person who will be buying the car. This is the same with any product or service. It's easy to recognize the audience when you are making a product because the product is designed around the customer's wants and needs.

But what about in a work presentation where you want your team's ideas to be taken seriously, or an interview where you have to seem competent in a situation where you have very little information, or a community mural where you want to inspire young children to dream bigger? Each of those instances where things are being make, be they slides, a painting, or a conversation, the audience should drive the decision making process. If they aren't the focus, a bad outcome is more likely to occur.

**Here are some examples of audience:**

- **Architect:** building inhabitants, engineers, code inspectors, construction workers
- **A supermarket owner:** shoppers, suppliers, workers
- **Hollywood film producer:** causal movie-goers, hardcore fans
- **Politician:** voters, foreign leaders
- **Book publisher:** genre fan-base
- **Activist:** general public
- **Professor:** students, colleagues, promotion committees
