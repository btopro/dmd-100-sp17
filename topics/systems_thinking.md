# Systems thinking
A design decision that considers the impact on an entire network of affected systems, rather than a specific part, is known as systems thinking. Systems are bounded, can be nested, overlap with other systems, are autonomous in operation, parts can be distributed or co-located, and interact with the larger environment.

If you consider that an expert in any given field is an expert on the system or systems situated in that field, then people who work across systems from different fields can be considered to be transdisciplinary. A transdisciplinarian is a multi-systems worker and takes liberty to follow the networked paths for more holistic perspectives on a problem. 


## Design field examples

Cradle-to-cradle design accounts for social, economic, and ecological systems when designing consumer products and services. Let us consider the issue of large congregations of plastic in the sea, described on the website for the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration:

[How Big Is the "Great Pacific Garbage Patch"? Science vs. Myth](http://response.restoration.noaa.gov/about/media/how-big-great-pacific-garbage-patch-science-vs-myth.html)

How did the plastic get there, and who might have been involved? Here is a list of scenarios that might have contributed.

1. Material producers: **Material design**
  - Plastic becomes easy to produce, making glass unappealing
2. Business and economics: **Product Design**
  - Availability of cheap plastic materials and mass production technology.
  - Business goals and values do not align with minimizing impact to existing ecological system
3. Public consensus:** Marketing design**
  - Ad campaigns infiltrate popular culture
  - Wastefulness is normalized
4. Waste management processes: **Service Design**
  - Wastefulness is good for business
  - No real long-term ecological considerations for disposal
5. Government: **Policy Design**
  - Special interest lobbying prevents ecological policies from hindering sales of products
  - Issue not prioritized by society
  - Recycling initiatives are not timely and universally ineffective
