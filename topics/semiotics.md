# Semiotics

### Semiotics

From nature, we can see that animals have distinctive patterns, textures, and colors which serve both utilitarian and symbolic functions. Vibrantly colored insects may indicate that they are poisonous to predators while bird songs, feathers, and nests communicate sexual fitness. Humans are no different, displaying or obscuring attributes for the same ends. These are semiotic processes.

Semiotics is the study of signs, symbols, and their interpretation. \[3\] A **sign** is composed of a signifier and signified. A **signifier** is the form of the sign and can be auditory, visual, or physical in nature. A famous play on this idea is the Magritte painting of a pipe with the words "Ceci n'est pas une pipe." \(This is not a pipe.\)\[4\]

The three categories of signifiers are the **\(1\) Icon**, **\(2\) Symbol** and **\(3\) Index**. An icon resembles some physical attribute of the signified. A symbol is an arbitrary form that is connected to the signified only through cultural association and convention. The fact that you can understand this text is because it is a symbol. An index is some manifestation or result of the existence of the signified. For instance, a traffic cone on the highway is an index for construction.

The **signified** is the conceptual idea. If you were to write the word _spoon_, that word would be a symbol that signifies something about the referenced object that is a spoon.
