# Discursive design

In 2009, Dr. Bruce M. Tharp and Stephanie M. Tharp published a blog post called ["The 4 Fields of Industrial Design: (No, not furniture, trans, consumer electronics, & toys)."](http://www.core77.com/posts/12232/the-4-fields-of-industrial-design-no-not-furniture-trans-consumer-electronics-toys-by-bruce-m-tharp-and-stephanie-m-tharp-12232) in an attempt to categorize design intentions. As described in a followup post published on Dec. 9, 2015, ["What is Discursive Design?,"](http://www.core77.com/posts/41991/What-is-Discursive-Design) discursive design is described as the practice of designing for the purpose of provoking thought.
