# ![](/assets/superstudio_quaderna_sitin.jpg)Discursive design

In 2009, Dr. Bruce M. Tharp and Stephanie M. Tharp published a blog post called ["The 4 Fields of Industrial Design: \(No, not furniture, trans, consumer electronics, & toys\)."](http://www.core77.com/posts/12232/the-4-fields-of-industrial-design-no-not-furniture-trans-consumer-electronics-toys-by-bruce-m-tharp-and-stephanie-m-tharp-12232) in an attempt to categorize design intentions. \[1\] As described in a followup post published on Dec. 9, 2015, ["What is Discursive Design?,"](http://www.core77.com/posts/41991/What-is-Discursive-Design) discursive design is described as the practice of designing for the purpose of provoking thought.

> This, of course, demands a purposeful shift—the designed object’s _primary_ role is no longer utilitarian, aesthetic or commercial. Instead it is mostly \(though certainly not exclusively\) a thought catalyst. The product is given form and function so that it can communicate ideas—this is the goal and the measure of success. Rather than tools for living and doing, these are tools for thinking. \[2\]

## Speculative design

If discursive design is "design as thought catalyst" then, speculative design is design as _possibility_ catalyst—that is, design for the purpose of imagining new possible futures—enabling ourselves to have real conversations about what kind of world we want to build. In the 1960s, an architecture group, called Superstudio, imagined new kinds of radical architectural design, which helped push design from problem-solving to problem-seeking. This form of design has autonomy from the constraints of the market, and has the benefit of self-reflection.

> And, whereas traditional design actually legitimizes the status quo, speculative design envisages and anticipates the future, at the same time help- ing us to understand and re-think the world of today. This approach is most often based on the question “what if?”, examining the interrelation between potential changes in the technological development and social relations. \[3\]

### Potential Futures and the Theory of Change

Because speculative design is concerned about the future, it is helpful for us to consider something called the **Theory of Change**, which helps a designer map outcomes and causalities. The "Three 'Laws' of Futures," as outlined by Joseph Voros, states that **\(1\) the future is not  predetermined**, **\(2\) the future is not predictable**, and **\(3\) the future outcomes can be influenced by our choices in the present**. Voros' publication, A Primer on Futures Studies, Foresight and the Use of Scenarios is worth a read to better understand his logic behind these "laws," but essentially they point to the idea that each present moment is the culmination of past choices, and therefore, future outcomes can be regarded as something to steward with thoughtful intent. It's contributing logic behind the importance of being responsible for your actions.

Theory of change is therefore concerned with figuring out what choices can to be made in order to achieve positive future outcomes.

> Theory of change is a rigorous yet participatory process whereby groups and stakeholders in a planning process articulate their long-term goals and identify the conditions they believe have to unfold for those goals to be met. These conditions are modeled as desired outcomes, arranged graphically in a causal framework. \[6\]

#### Steps for mapping a Theory of Change problem:

If you look carefully at this list, you an also simultaneously locate a place for each step within the Double Diamond design process used throughout this course, further illustrating it's compatibility with other design processes. I've adapted this list from Theory of Change Basics: A PRIMER ON THEORY OF CHANGE by Taplin and Clark, published in 2012.

1. Identify long-term goals and related assumptions.
2. Map backwards from long-term goal: Identify preconditions and requirements.
3. Note your assumptions of how the system works; articulate your rationale for why outcomes are necessary preconditions to other outcomes.
4. Develop strategic interventions to bring about your desired change.
5. Develop indicators to measure successfulness of outcomes; use them to assess the performance of your initiative.
6. Quality review should answer three basic questions: Is your theory 1\) plausible, 2\) “doable” \(or feasible\), and 3\) testable?
7. Produce a narrative to communicate the logic of your initiative.

You can start to see where those steps, particularly in step 6, begin to line up within the PPPP model \(described by Voros\). The the four classes of potential futures include probable, plausible, possible, and preferable.
