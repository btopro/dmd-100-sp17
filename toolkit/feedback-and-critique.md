# Feedback and critique

Let's say you just pulled an all-nighter to get a project finished \(unfortunately very common for art and design students\). It's a masterpiece, and you can't wait to unveil it to unfettered acclaim from your peers. However, you show your work to everyone, and the response you get does not sound like praise. In fact, they say things like "it's not working" or "I don't understand why you did that ..." and you are devastated.

Unless you had brutally honest parents growing up, you might not be used to a negative response to your creative work, particularly work in which you have invested considerable effort. Letting go of emotional attachment to your work will greatly help you with the ability to self-evaluate more objectively. Praise can certainly happen in feedback or critique and is a great way to communicate when you've done something well, but you should remain skeptical of too much praise. Unwarranted praise can really hold your work back, blinding you from where your weaknesses lie. If your work needs improvement, you need to know about it in order to improve, and this is the main goal of feedback.

Feedback can come in various forms, including advice, compliments,  

## Trolling

A troll is a person who is intent on disrupting constructive discussion by posting inflammatory remarks to halt the progress of a discussionâ€“typically for the purposes of self-amusement or for the emotional high of winning an argument. This happens in online \(and sometimes offline\) spaces that lack established social norms or policy enforcement.

In an academic setting, the instructor sets the social norms of the classroom and maintains authority over moderating a discussion. It is not an instructor's job to be "thought police." Therefore, if a student has an opinion that is counter to the general opinions of the class, voicing those opinions are encouraged to provoke thoughtful discussion. However, disrespectful remarks meant to oppress another student will be considered trolling behavior and will not be allowed to continue without consequence.

Trolling is the antithetical to meaningful discussion, so try to be mindful that your remarks \(possibly being written under some emotional stress\) don't accidentally veer off course and shut down a conversation.
